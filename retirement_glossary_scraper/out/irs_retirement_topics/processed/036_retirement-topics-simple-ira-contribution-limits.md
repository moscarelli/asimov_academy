# Retirement Topics - SIMPLE IRA Contribution Limits

## Introduction
The SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees Individual Retirement Account) IRA contribution limits determine how much you, as an employee or business owner, can contribute to a SIMPLE IRA plan each year.

## Contributions
Contributions include:

* Salary reduction contributions: the amount an employee contributes from their salary to a SIMPLE IRA cannot exceed $16,000 in 2024.
* Employer matching contributions: employers must match employee salary reduction contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 3% of compensation. Employers may also choose to make nonelective contributions of 2% of eligible employees' compensation.

## Catch-up Contributions
If you are age 50 or over at the end of the calendar year, you can make catch-up contributions to your SIMPLE IRA plan, which is $3,500 in 2023 and 2024.

## Nonelective Contributions
Employers may choose to make nonelective contributions instead of matching contributions. If an employer makes this choice, they must notify employees within a reasonable period before the 60-day election period for the calendar year.

## Time Limits for Contributing Funds
Employers must deposit employees' salary reduction contributions to the SIMPLE IRA within 30 days after the end of the month in which the employee would have received them in cash. They must also make matching contributions or nonelective contributions by the due date (including extensions) of their federal income tax return.

## Important Dates

* $16,000: the maximum amount an employee can contribute to a SIMPLE IRA in 2024.
* 3%: the maximum percentage of compensation that employers must match for salary reduction contributions.
* 2%: the percentage of eligible employees' compensation that employers may choose to make nonelective contributions of.
* $3450,000: the compensation amount up to which an employer's contributions are taken into account when determining the contribution limit.
* $3,500: the catch-up contribution limit for SIMPLE IRA plans in 2023 and 2024.
* March 1st (or the next business day): the due date for employers to deposit employees' salary reduction contributions.

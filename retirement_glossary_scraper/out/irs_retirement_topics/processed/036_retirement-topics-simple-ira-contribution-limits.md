# Retirement Topics - SIMPLE IRA Contribution Limits
## Introduction

This section provides information on the contribution limits for SIMPLE IRAs, including salary reduction contributions, employer matching and nonelective contributions.

### Salary Reduction Contributions

* The amount an employee contributes from their salary to a SIMPLE IRA cannot exceed $16,000 in 2024.
* If an employee participates in any other employer plan during the year and has elective salary reductions under those plans, the total amount of the salary reduction contributions that an employee can make to all the plans he or she participates in is limited to $23,000 in 2024.

### Catch-up Contributions

* If permitted by the SIMPLE IRA plan, participants who are age 50 or over at the end of the calendar year can also make catch-up contributions. The catch-up contribution limit for SIMPLE IRA plans is $3,500 in 2023 and 2024.

### Employer Matching and Nonelective Contributions

* The employer is generally required to match each employee's salary reduction contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 3% of the employee's compensation.
* An employer may choose to make a matching contribution less than 3%, but it must be at least 1% and for no more than 2 out of 5 years.
* Instead of matching contributions, an employer can choose to make nonelective contributions of 2% of each eligible employee's compensation.

# Valuation of Plan Assets at Fair Market Value

## Overview

Plan assets must be valued at fair market value, not cost. An accurate assessment of fair market value is essential to a plan's ability to comply with the Internal Revenue Code requirements and Title I of ERISA.

## Importance of Accurate Valuation

Accurate valuation of plan assets is crucial for several reasons:

*   Prohibited transactions
*   Exclusive benefit violations under IRC section 401(a)
*   Violations of the section 415 limitation on benefits and contributions
*   Excess deductions under IRC section 404
*   Violations of the IRC section 412 minimum funding requirements
*   Discrimination violations under IRC section 401(a)(4)

## Valuation Requirements for Different Plan Types

The following plan types require valuation at a specified frequency:

*   Profit-sharing, money purchase, or stock bonus plans: assets' valuation determines participant's account value and ultimately distribution
*   Defined contribution plans: Revenue Ruling 80–155 requires valuing trust investments at least once a year on a specified date according to a method consistently followed and uniformly applied
*   Defined benefit plans: IRC section 412 requires yearly plan asset valuations for funding purposes, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions

## Valuation Methods and Assumptions

Valuation methods and assumptions may vary depending on the specific plan type and industry. The following are some common valuation methods:

*   Fair market value (FMV) method
*   Asset-based method
*   Income approach

Actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates and mortality tables, must be used to determine the fair market value of plan assets.

## Frequency of Valuations

The frequency of valuations depends on the type of plan:

*   Defined benefit plans: yearly valuations
*   Profit-sharing, money purchase, or stock bonus plans: annually
*   Other plans: as required by IRS regulations

 Failure to comply with valuation requirements may result in penalties and fines.

## Conclusion

Accurate valuation of plan assets is essential for compliance with IRS regulations and to avoid potential penalties. Plan administrators must ensure that valuations are performed regularly and according to established methods and assumptions.

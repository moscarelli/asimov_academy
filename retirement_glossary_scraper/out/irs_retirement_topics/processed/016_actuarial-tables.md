# Actuarial Tables

The tax law requires that you use these actuarial tables to value annuities, life estates, remainders and reversions, with certain exceptions. These actuarial tables do not apply to qualified retirement arrangements. They also do not apply to limited situations indicated in the regulations at sections 1.7520-3, 20.7520-3 and 25.7520-3.

## Prior and Current Actuarial Tables

Prior tables are derived from mortality experience around the year 2000 (Table 2000CM). They apply to valuation dates of May 1, 2009, through May 31, 2023.

Current tables are derived from mortality experience around 2010 (Table 2010CM). They are referenced in final regulations effective on June 1, 2023, and apply to valuation dates of June 1, 2023, and thereafter.

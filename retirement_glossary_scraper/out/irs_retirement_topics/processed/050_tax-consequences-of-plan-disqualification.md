Tax Consequences of Plan Disqualification
==========================================

When an Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) retirement plan is disqualified, the plan's trust loses its tax-exempt status and becomes a nonexempt trust. This has significant consequences for employees, employers, and the plan itself.

**Who is Affected?**

The plan disqualification affects three groups:

1. **Employees**: Generally, an employee would include in income any employer contributions made to the trust for their benefit in the calendar years the plan is disqualified.
2. **Employer**: The timing and amount of the employer's deduction for amounts it contributes to the trust are limited after plan disqualification.
3. **The Plan's Trust**: Once disqualified, the trust loses its tax-exempt status and becomes a nonexempt trust.

**Consequence 1: General Rule - Employee Inclusion in Income**

In the event of plan disqualification, an employee would include in income any employer contributions made to the trust for their benefit in the calendar years the plan is disqualified, to the extent the employee is vested in those contributions. For example, if Pat is a participant in a profit-sharing plan and contributes $3,000 in one year and $4,000 in another year, she would have to include $3,000 in income in the first year and $4,000 in the second year.

**Exceptions**

There are exceptions to the general rule. If the sole reason for disqualification is failure to meet either the additional participation or minimum coverage requirements, a highly compensated employee (as defined by IRC section 414(q)) would include all of their vested account balance in income. A non-highly compensated employee would only include employer contributions made to their account in the years that the plan is not qualified.

**Consequence 2: Employer Deductions Limited**

Once the plan is disqualified, different rules apply to the timing and amount of the employer's deduction for amounts it contributes to the trust. The employer cannot deduct the contribution until it is includible in the employee's gross income.

**Important Notes**

* Any failure to satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements (IRC section 401(a)(4)) is considered a failure to meet the minimum coverage requirements.
* Non-highly compensated employees do not include in income any employer contributions made to their accounts in disqualified years until the amounts are paid to them.

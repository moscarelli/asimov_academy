Tax Consequences of Plan Disqualification
=============================================

When an Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) retirement plan is disqualified, the plan's trust loses its tax-exempt status and becomes a nonexempt trust. This affects three groups:

*   Employees: Must include employer contributions in gross income.
*   Employer: Deductions for contributions are limited until the contribution is includible in the employee's gross income.
*   The Plan's Trust: Loses tax-exempt status and becomes a nonexempt trust.

**Consequence 1: General Rule - Employees Include Contributions in Gross Income**

Generally, an employee would include in income any employer contributions made to the trust for their benefit in the calendar years the plan is disqualified to the extent the employee is vested in those contributions.

In our example, Pat would have to include $3,000 in her income in calendar year 1 and $4,000 in her income in calendar year 2 to reflect the employer contributions paid to the trust for her benefit in each of those calendar years. If Pat was only 20% vested in her employer contributions in calendar year 1, then she would only include $600 in her calendar year 1 income.

**Exceptions**

*   Failure to meet either the additional participation or minimum coverage requirements.
*   Highly compensated employees: Include all of their vested account balance (any amount that wasn’t already taxed) in their income.
*   Non-highly compensated employees: Only include employer contributions made to their accounts in the years that the plan is not qualified to the extent they are vested in those contributions.

**Consequence 2: Employer Deductions Are Limited**

Once the plan is disqualified, different rules apply to the timing and amount of the employer's deduction for amounts it contributes to the trust. Unlike the rules for contributions to a trust under a qualified plan, if an employer contributes to a nonexempt employees' trust, it cannot deduct the contribution until the contribution is includible in the employee's gross income.

If both the employer and employee are calendar year taxpayers, the employer's deduction is delayed until the calendar year in which the contribution amount is includible in the employee's gross income.

If the employer has a different taxable year than the employee (a non-calendar fiscal year), the employer cannot take a deduction for its contribution until its first taxable year that ends after the last day of the employee's taxable year in which the amount is included in the employee's gross income.

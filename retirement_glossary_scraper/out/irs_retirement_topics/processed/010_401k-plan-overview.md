# 401(k) Plan Overview
A 401(k) plan is a qualified plan that includes a feature allowing an employee to elect to have the employer contribute a portion of the employee's wages to an individual account under the plan.

## Tax Advantages
Two tax advantages of sponsoring a 401(k) plan are:

*   Employer contributions are deductible on the employer's federal income tax return to the extent that the contributions do not exceed the limitations described in section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.
*   Elective deferrals and investment gains are not currently taxed and enjoy tax deferral until distribution.

## Types Available
There are several types of 401(k) plans available to employers:

*   Traditional 401(k) plans: allow eligible employees to make pre-tax elective deferrals through payroll deductions, and employers can make matching contributions based on employees' elective deferrals.
*   Safe Harbor 401(k) plans: provide for employer contributions that are fully vested when made, and may be limited to employees who defer or employers who make contributions on behalf of all eligible employees.
*   SIMPLE 401(k) plans: have simpler qualification rules than traditional plans and do not require annual testing.

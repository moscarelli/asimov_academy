# 401(k) Plan Overview
A 401(k) plan is a qualified plan that includes a feature allowing an employee to elect to have the employer contribute a portion of the employee's wages to an individual account under the plan. The underlying plan can be a profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISA money purchase pension, or a rural cooperative plan.

## Tax Advantages

Two of the tax advantages of sponsoring a 401(k) plan are:

* Employer contributions are deductible on the employer's federal income tax return to the extent that the contributions do not exceed the limitations described in section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.
* Elective deferrals and investment gains are not currently taxed and enjoy tax deferral until distribution.

## Types Available

There are several types of 401(k) plans available to employers:

* Traditional 401(k) plans
* Safe harbor 401(k) plans
* SIMPLE 401(k) plans

Each type has different rules that apply. To qualify for the tax benefits, a plan must be operated in accordance with the applicable rules.

### Traditional 401(k) Plans

A traditional 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to make pre-tax elective deferrals through payroll deductions. Employers can also make contributions on behalf of all participants, making matching contributions based on employees' elective deferrals, or both. Employer contributions can be subject to a vesting schedule.

### Safe Harbor 401(k) Plans

A safe harbor 401(k) plan is similar to a traditional 401(k) plan, but it must provide for employer contributions that are fully vested when made. These contributions may be employer matching contributions, limited to employees who defer, or employer contributions made on behalf of all eligible employees.

### SIMPLE 401(k) Plans

Simple 401(k) plans have fewer requirements and restrictions compared to traditional 401(k) plans.

# Defined Benefit Plan
A defined benefit retirement plan provides a fixed, pre-established benefit for employees at retirement.

## Pros and Cons

*   Substantial benefits can be provided and accrued within a short time – even with early retirement
*   Employers can contribute (and deduct) more than under other retirement plans
*   Plan provides a predictable benefit
*   Vesting can follow a variety of schedules from immediate to spread out over seven years
*   Benefits are not dependent on asset returns
*   Plan can be used to promote certain business strategies by offering subsidized early retirement benefits

However, defined benefit plans are often more complex and, thus, more costly to establish and maintain than other types of plans.

## Who Contributes
Generally, the employer makes most contributions. Sometimes, employee contributions are required, or voluntary contributions may be permitted.

## Contribution and Benefit Limits
Benefits provided under the plan are limited. Deduction limit is any amount up to the plan’s unfunded current liability (see an enrolled actuary for further details).

## Filing Requirements
Annual filing of Form 5500 is required.  An enrolled actuary must sign the Schedule B of Form 5500.

## Participant Loans
A defined benefit plan may permit participant loans.

## In-Service Withdrawals
Generally, a defined benefit plan may not make in-service distributions to a participant before age 59 1/2.

## Hybrid Plans
Hybrid plans have specific interest crediting rules and are subject to certain effective dates being postponed.

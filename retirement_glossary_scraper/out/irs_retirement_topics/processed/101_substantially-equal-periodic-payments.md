# Substantially Equal Periodic Payments
## Introduction

Substantially equal periodic payments (SoSEPP) are a way to take distributions from certain retirement plans without incurring the 10% additional tax on early distributions. In this article, we will explain how SoSEPPs work and provide guidance on their application.

## What is a Substantially Equal Periodic Payment?

A SoSEPP is a series of payments made at regular intervals over an individual's life expectancy or the life expectancies of the taxpayer and the taxpayer's designated beneficiary. These payments are determined to be substantially equal in value and amount, with respect to the period covered by the applicable rules.

## Are SoSEPPs Available for All Retirement Plans?

SoSEPPs are available for qualified retirement plans, including:

*   401(a) plans
*   Annuity plans described in Section 403(a)
*   Annuity contracts described in Section 403(b)
*   Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) described in Section 408(a)
*   Individual retirement annuities described in Section 408(b)

## How Do I Determine My Life Expectancy?

To determine your life expectancy, you can use the following resources:

*   The Social Security Administration's Actuarial Life Table
*   A qualified actuary or financial advisor

## Can I Split My Annual Amount into Installments During the Year?

Yes, you can split your annual amount into installments during the year. However, this may affect your SoSEPP and result in additional tax.

## What Happens if I Modify My SoSEPP?

If you modify your SoSEPP by taking an annual amount that is different from the annual amount determined under the method originally established, you will be subject to additional tax.

## Can I Change to a Different Method After Receiving a SoSEPP Payment?

Yes, after receiving a SoSEPP payment, you can change to a different method. However, this may result in additional tax and penalties.

## How Do I Fulfill the SoSEPP Requirements for My Account?

To fulfill the SoSEPP requirements for your account, you must:

*   Make substantially equal periodic payments over an individual's life expectancy or the life expectancies of the taxpayer and the taxpayer's designated beneficiary
*   Determine the annual amount using one of the three methods
*   Not make any additions to the account or take any payments from the account in addition to the SoSEPP payments

## Are There Any Other Exceptions to the 10% Additional Tax?

Yes, there are other exceptions to the 10% additional tax on early distributions from certain retirement plans. These include:

*   Distributions made after separation from service with the employer maintaining the plan
*   Distributions made under a qualified SEPP
*   Distributions made from an individual retirement account (IRA)

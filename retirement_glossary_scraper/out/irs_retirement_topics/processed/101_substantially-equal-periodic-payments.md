Substantially Equal Periodic Payments
=====================

What is a Substantially Equal Periodic Payment?
---------------------------------------------

A Substantially Equal Periodic Payment (SoSEPP) is a way to make regular payments from a retirement account without having to withdraw the entire balance at once. SoSEPPs are allowed under Section 72(t)(2)(A)(iv) of the Internal Revenue Code.

### Exceptions to the 10% Additional Tax

There is an exception to the 10% additional tax on early distributions from certain retirement plans if the payments are made as a series of substantially equal periodic payments for life. This applies if:

*   The taxpayer must be separated from service with the employer maintaining the plan before the payments begin.
*   Once established, the taxpayer cannot make any additions to the account or take any payments from the account, other than the SoSEPP payments.
*   The taxpayer cannot have more than one SoSEPP in effect for the account for any year.

### Determining the Annual Amount

The annual amount of a SoSEPP is determined under one of three methods:

1.  **Actuarial Method**: This method takes into account the taxpayer's life expectancy and the expected rate of return on investments.
2.  **Benchmarks Method**: This method uses a benchmark interest rate to determine the annual amount.
3.  **Pension Benefit Estimator (PBES) Method**: This method uses a formula to estimate the annual amount based on the account balance.

### Modifications to SoSEPP

If the taxpayer modifies their SoSEPP by taking an annual amount that is different from the original amount, they may be subject to additional taxes. However, if the modification is due to reason of death, disability, or dismemberment, it will not affect the prohibition against making additional contributions to the account or taking distributions from the account in addition to the SoSEPP payments.

### Effects on Account Balance

When the taxpayer receives a SoSEPP payment determined under one method, they can change to another method. However, if the account balance is completely depleted, this may impact their eligibility for future SoSEPPs.

### Acceptable Methods of Determining a SoSEPP

The three methods mentioned above are considered acceptable ways of determining a SoSEPP.

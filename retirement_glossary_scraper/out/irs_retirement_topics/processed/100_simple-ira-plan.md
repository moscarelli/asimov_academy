# SIMPLE IRA Plan
A SIMPLE IRA plan allows employees and employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees. It is ideally suited as a start-up retirement savings plan for small employers not currently sponsoring a retirement plan.

## Choosing a SIMPLE IRA Plan
* Establish a SIMPLE IRA Plan
* Participate in a SIMPLE IRA Plan
* Operate and Maintain a SIMPLE IRA Plan
* Correct SIMPLE IRA plan errors
* Terminate a SIMPLE IRA Plan

## Benefits of a SIMPLE IRA Plan
* Easy and inexpensive to set up and operate
* Employees share responsibility for their retirement
* No discrimination testing required

## Contribution Requirements
* Employer must contribute:
	+ 3% of compensation (matching contribution) or
	+ 2% nonelective contribution for each eligible employee
* Employees may elect to contribute, with no limit on the amount contributed by an individual

## How a SIMPLE IRA Plan Works
Example 1:

* Elizabeth works for Rockland Quarry Company and contributes 5% of her $50,000 compensation ($2,500) to her SIMPLE IRA.
* Rockland matches Elizabeth's contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 3%.
* Total contribution is $4,000.

Example 2:

* Austin works for Skidmore Tire Company and does not contribute to his SIMPLE IRA.
* Skidmore makes a 2% nonelective contribution of $800.

## Pros and Cons
Pros:
* Easy and inexpensive to set up and operate
* Employees share responsibility for their retirement

# SIMPLE IRA Plan
## Overview

A **SIMPLE IRA plan** allows employees and employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees. It is ideally suited as a start-up retirement savings plan for small employers not currently sponsoring a retirement plan.

## Choosing and Establishing a SIMPLE IRA Plan

*   **Choose a SIMPLE IRA plan**: This involves selecting a prototype or individually designed plan document.
*   **Establish a SIMPLE IRA plan**: Adopt the selected plan document and follow the necessary procedures.
*   **Participate in a SIMPLE IRA plan**: Employees and employers must agree to participate in the plan.
*   **Operate and Maintain a SIMPLE IRA Plan**: Ensure compliance with IRS regulations and maintain accurate records.

## Contributions

The employer is required to contribute each year either:

1.  A matching contribution up to 3% of compensation
2.  A nonelective contribution of 2% for each eligible employee

Even if an eligible employee doesn't contribute, they must still receive an employer contribution equal to 2% of their compensation.

## Key Features and Benefits

*   **Easy and inexpensive**: SIMPLE IRA plans are relatively low-cost and easy to set up.
*   **Employees share responsibility**: Both employees and employers contribute to the plan.
*   **No discrimination testing required**: This simplifies administration and compliance.

However, contributions have lower limits than some other retirement plans.

# Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP)

## Introduction

A SEP plan allows employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees. Any business, including self-employed individuals, can establish a SEP.

## How a SEP Works

*   The employer sets aside money in retirement accounts for themselves and their employees.
*   A SEP does not have the start-up and operating costs of a conventional retirement plan and allows for a contribution of up to 25 percent of each employee's pay.
*   Employee is always 100% vested in (or, has ownership of) all SEP-IRA money.

## Benefits

*   Easy to set up and operate
*   Low administrative costs
*   Flexible annual contributions – good plan if cash flow is an issue

## Key Features

*   Employer contributions only.
*   Total contributions to each employee's SEP-IRA are limited.
*   An employer generally has no filing requirements.

## Eligibility

*   Any size business
*   Self-employed individuals can also establish a SEP.

# Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP)

A SEP plan allows employers to contribute to traditional IRAs (SEP-IRAS) set up for employees. A business of any size, including self-employed individuals, can establish a SEP.

## Choosing and Establishing a SEP Plan

*   Available to any size business
*   Easily established by adopting a SEP prototype or individually designed plan document (Form 5305-SEP)
*   No filing requirement for the employer
*   Only the employer contributes to traditional IRAS (SEP-IRAs) set up for each eligible employee
*   Employee is always 100% vested in (or has ownership of) all SEP-IRA money

## How a SEP Works

*   Jed works for the Rambling RV Company and decides to establish a SEP for its employees.
*   The contribution rate must be uniform for all employees, and the financial institution that Rambling RV has chosen for its SEP has several investment funds from which to choose.
*   Employee contributions are not permitted; employer contributions only.

## Pros and Cons of SEPs

*   Easy to set up and operate
*   Low administrative costs
*   Flexible annual contributions – good plan if cash flow is an issue
*   Employer must contribute equally for all eligible employees
*   Contribution limits: Total contributions to each employee's SEP-IRA are limited.
*   Filing requirements: An employer generally has no filing requirements.
*   Participant loans: Not permitted. The assets may not be used as collateral.
*   In-service withdrawals: Yes, but includible in income and subject to a 10% additional tax if under age 59 1/2.

## Establishing a SEP Plan

1.  Choose a financial institution to serve as trustee of the SEP-IRAs that will hold each employee's retirement plan assets.
2.  Execute a written agreement to provide benefits to all eligible employees, including:
    *   The name of the employer
    *   Requirements for employee participation
    *   Signature of a responsible official
    *   A definite allocation formula
3.  Give employees certain information about the agreement.
4.  Set up an IRA account for each employee.

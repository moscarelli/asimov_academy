# Saving for Retirement
## Overview

The IRS provides information on saving for retirement, including types of plans, required minimum distributions, and estimated income.

### Types of Retirement Plans
*   **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts)**
    *   Traditional IRAs
    *   Roth IRAs
    *   Rollover IRAs
*   **Employer-Sponsored Plans**
    *   401(k)
    *   403(b)
    *   Thrift Savings Plan

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
*   When to take RMDs: beginning the year you turn age 72.
*   How much to take: at least a percentage of your account balance, based on your life expectancy.

### Investment Options
*   **Participant-Directed Accounts**
    *   Choose investments for your retirement account.
    *   Some plans may have investment options that are not available in traditional accounts.
*   **Fees**
    *   Be aware of fees associated with investing in your retirement account.
    *   Fees can reduce your returns over time.

### Retirement Savings Tips
*   **Start Early**
    *   The earlier you start saving for retirement, the more time your money has to grow.
*   **Contribute as Much as Possible**
    *   Contribute at least enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
*   **Diversify Your Investments**
    *   Spread your investments across different asset classes to minimize risk.

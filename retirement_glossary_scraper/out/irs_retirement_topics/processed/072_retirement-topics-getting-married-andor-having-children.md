# Retirement Topics - Getting Married and/or Having Children

After getting married or having children (including adopted and stepchildren), a participant should immediately review, and possibly update, their retirement plan beneficiaries. Generally, the retirement plan can only pay benefits to a participant's named beneficiaries upon their death.

Most plans require a married participant to obtain his or her spouse's written consent to change beneficiaries and/or the form in which the plan will pay out benefits.

### To Change Beneficiaries

*   contact his or her employer or plan administrator to request change of beneficiary forms;
*   complete those forms in accordance with their instructions, including obtaining his or her spouse's signature, if applicable; and
*   submit the completed and signed forms to the employer or plan administrator.

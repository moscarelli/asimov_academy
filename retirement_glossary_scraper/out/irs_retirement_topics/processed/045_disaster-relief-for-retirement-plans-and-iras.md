# Disaster Relief for Retirement Plans and IRAs

In the event of a presidentially declared disaster, the IRS will postpone certain retirement plan and IRA deadlines for affected taxpayers.

## Eligible Taxpayers

Affected taxpayers are generally people who live in or have a business in an area directly impacted by the disaster.

### Types of Relief

The IRS may postpone all or only certain deadlines listed in Revenue Procedure 2018-58 based on when the disaster occurred and its severity as well as other factors.

## Postponed Deadlines

Some examples of postponed deadlines include:

*   Extending the 60-day period for plan participants to deposit eligible rollover distributions to another qualified plan or IRA
*   Extending the time for a qualified plan to make a required minimum distribution

# Retirement Topics - Contributions

## What is a Contribution?
A contribution is the amount an employer and employees (including self-employed individuals) pay into a retirement plan.

### Limits on Contributions and Benefits
There are limits to how much employers and employees can contribute to a plan (or IRA) each year. The plan must specifically state that contributions or benefits cannot exceed certain limits. The limits differ depending on the type of plan.

### Contribution Limits

*   IRA contribution limits: $23,000 in 2024, $22,500 in 2023, $20,500 in 2022, $19,500 in 2020 and 2021, and $19,000 in 2019, or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever is less.
*   401(k) and profit-sharing plan contribution limits: varies depending on the type of plan.
*   SEP contribution limits (including grandfathered SARSEPs): varies depending on the type of plan.
*   SIMPLE IRA contribution limits: $16,000 in 2024, $15,500 in 2023, $14,000 in 2022, and $13,500 in 2020 and 2021.
*   Catch-up contributions: permitted if the employee is age 50 or older.

### Time for Depositing Elective Deferrals
Employers must deposit employee contributions to the retirement plan's trust or individual accounts as soon as they can reasonably be segregated from the employer's general assets. The Department of Labor provides a 7-business-day safe harbor rule for employee contributions to plans with fewer than 100 participants.

### Employer Contributions
*   Employer matching contributions: if permitted by the plan document, employers can make matching contributions for an employee who contributes elective deferrals.
*   Employer discretionary or non-elective contributions: if permitted by the plan document, employers can make contributions other than matching contributions for participants.

# Retirement Topics - Contributions

## Introduction

A contribution is the amount an employer and employees (including self-employed individuals) pay into a retirement plan. The plan must specifically state that contributions or benefits cannot exceed certain limits.

### Contribution Limits

*   IRA contribution limits: $6,500 in 2024, $6,500 in 2023, $6,000 in 2022, $6,000 in 2020 and 2021, and $5,500 in 2019
*   401(k) and profit-sharing plan contribution limits: up to the employer's safe harbor limit or 25% of compensation
*   SEP contribution limits (including grandfathered SARSEPs): 20% of compensation
*   SIMPLE IRA contribution limits: 100% of compensation or $12,000 in 2024, $11,500 in 2023, $10,500 in 2022, and $9,000 in 2020 and 2021
*   403(b) contribution limits: up to the employer's safe harbor limit or 15% of compensation
*   457(b) contribution limits: up to the employer's safe harbor limit or 15% of compensation
*   Defined benefit plan benefit limits: varies depending on the plan

### Catch-up Contributions

Catch-up contributions may be allowed if the employee is age 50 or older. The catch-up contribution limit for IRA plans is $1,000 in 2024, and $500 in 2023.

### Time for Depositting Elective Deferrals

Employers must deposit employee contributions to the retirement plan's trust or individual accounts as soon as they can reasonably be segregated from the employer's general assets. The Department of Labor provides a 7-business-day safe harbor rule for employee contributions to plans with fewer than 100 participants.

### Employer Contributions

*   Employer matching contributions: if permitted by the plan document, employers can make matching contributions for an employee who contributes elective deferrals (e.g., 50 cents for each dollar deferred). Employer matching contributions can be discretionary or mandatory.
*   Employer non-elective contributions: if permitted by the plan document, employers can make contributions other than matching contributions for participants.

### Types of Employee Contributions

*   Salary reduction/elective deferral contributions: pre-tax employee contributions that are a percentage of the employee's compensation. Some plans permit the employee to contribute a specific dollar amount each pay period.
*   Designated Roth contributions: a type of elective contribution that is currently includible in gross income but tax-free when distributed (available in 401(k), 403(b), and governmental 457(b) plans).
*   After-tax contributions: contributions from compensation (other than Roth contributions) that an employee must include in income on their tax return.

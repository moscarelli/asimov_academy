# Choosing a Retirement Plan: Profit Sharing Plan

A profit-sharing plan accepts discretionary employer contributions. There is no set amount that the law requires you to contribute. If you can afford to make some amount of contributions to the plan for a particular year, you can do so. Other years, you do not need to make contributions.

**Key Features**

*   Contributions are strictly discretionary
*   No set amount is required by law
*   Employer contributions only

**Pros and Cons**

*   Flexible contributions
*   Good plan if cash flow is an issue
*   Administrative costs may be higher than under more basic arrangements (SEP or SIMPLE IRA plans)
*   Need to test that benefits do not discriminate in favor of the highly compensated employees.

**Contribution Limits**

The lesser of 100% of compensation or $69,000 for 2024 ($66,000 for 2023; $61,000 for 2022; $58,000 for 2021; $57,000 for 2020, subject to cost-of-living adjustments for later years).

**Filing Requirements**

Annual filing of a Form 5500-series return/report is required. Participant disclosures are also required.

**Participant Loans and In-Service Withdrawals**

Permitted, but subject to possible 10% additional tax if under age 59-1/2 and no other exception applies.

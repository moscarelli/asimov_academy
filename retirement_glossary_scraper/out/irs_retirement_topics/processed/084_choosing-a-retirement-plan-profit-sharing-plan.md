# Choosing a Retirement Plan: Profit Sharing Plan

A profit-sharing plan accepts discretionary employer contributions. There is no set amount that the law requires you to contribute. If you can afford to make some amount of contributions to the plan for a particular year, you can do so.

Other years, you do not need to make contributions. Your business does not need profits to make contributions to a profit-sharing plan.

If you do make contributions, you will need to have a set formula for determining how the contributions are divided. This money goes into a separate account for each employee.

One common method for determining each participant's allocation in a profit-sharing plan is the "comp-to-comp" method. Under this method, the employer calculates the sum of all of its employees' compensation (the total "comp"). To determine each employee's allocation of the employer's contribution, you divide the employee's compensation (employee "comp") by the total comp. You then multiply each employee's fraction by the amount of the employer contribution.

If you establish a profit-sharing plan:

*   Can have other retirement plans
*   Can be a business of any size
*   Need to annually file a Form 5500
*   As with 401(k) plans, you can make a profit-sharing plan as simple or as complex as you want

**Pros and Cons:**

*   Flexible contributions – contributions are strictly discretionary
*   Good plan if cash flow is an issue
*   Administrative costs may be higher than under more basic arrangements (SEP or SIMPLE IRA plans)
*   Need to test that benefits do not discriminate in favor of the highly compensated employees.

**Who Contributes:**

Employer contributions only. If a salary deferral feature is added to a profit-sharing plan, it is a "401(k) plan."

**Contribution Limits:**

The lesser of 100% of compensation or $69,000 for 2024 ($66,000 for 2023; $61,000 for 2022; $58,000 for 2021; $57,000 for 2020, subject to cost-of-living adjustments for later years).

**Filing Requirements:**

Annual filing of a Form 5500-series return/report is required. Participant disclosures are also required.

**Participant Loans:**

Permitted.

**In-Service Withdrawals:**

Yes, but subject to possible 10% additional tax if under age 59-1/2 and no other exception applies.

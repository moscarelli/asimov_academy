Retirement topics - Bankruptcy of employer
=============================================

### Overview

An employer (plan sponsor) can file different types of bankruptcies: Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 reorganizational bankruptcy, liquidation bankruptcy under Chapter 7.

### Types of Bankruptcies

*   **Chapter 11**: The employer continues to operate its business and may be allowed to reorganize its financial affairs with court approval.
*   **Chapter 13**: The employer may continue or terminate any retirement plans it maintains with court approval.
*   **Chapter 7**: The Chapter 7 trustee obtains control over the business's assets, liquidates them to pay creditors, closes the business, and terminates all retirement plans.

### Protection of Retirement Plan Assets

The law protects participants' retirement plan assets by requiring:

*   The assets be kept separate from the employer's assets
*   The assets be held in trust or invested in insurance

If an employer terminates a defined benefit plan, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) may insure some benefits.

### Next Steps

If an employee is affected by their employer's bankruptcy, they should contact the plan administrator to get information on the type of bankruptcy filed and the status of their retirement plan.

# Retirement Topics - Bankruptcy of Employer

An employer (plan sponsor) can file different types of bankruptcies:

*   Chapter 11 or 13: The employer usually continues to operate its business under the Bankruptcy Court's protection and may be allowed to reorganize its financial affairs. It can decide to continue or terminate any retirement plans it maintains.
*   Chapter 7: The Chapter 7 trustee obtains control over all of the business's assets, liquidates them to pay creditors, closes the business before or at the end of the bankruptcy proceedings, and terminates the business's retirement plans.

The law protects participants' retirement plan assets from the bankrupt employer's creditors by requiring the assets be kept separate from the employer's assets and held in trust or invested in insurance.

If an employer in bankruptcy terminates its defined benefit plan or its defined contribution plan, all participants become 100% vested in their accrued benefits.

A participant in a bankrupt employer's retirement plan should immediately contact the plan administrator to get information on the type of bankruptcy filed by the employer and the status of their retirement plan.

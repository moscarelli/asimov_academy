# Retirement Plans Definitions
Retirement plans definitions
A defined contribution plan where an employee can make contributions from their paycheck either before or after-tax, depending on the options offered in the plan. The contributions go into a 401(k) account, with the employee often choosing the investments based on options provided under the plan.

The employer may also make contributions, such as matching the employee's contributions up to a certain percentage. SIMPLE and safe harbor 401(k) plans have mandatory employer contributions.

A retirement plan offered by public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations. An individual's 403(b) annuity can be obtained only under an employer's TSA plan. These annuities are funded by elective deferrals made under salary reduction agreements and nonelective employer contributions.

An annual test in a 401(k) plan that compares the average salary deferrals of highly compensated employees to that of nonhighly compensated employees. The ADP is used to determine if the plan complies with tax laws.

The total of all employer contributions, employee contributions (not including rollovers), and forfeitures allocated to a participant's account in a year.

A series of payments under a contract that are made at regular intervals and over a period of more than one year. Cash balance plans are a type of defined benefit plan.

A type of defined benefit plan that includes some elements similar to a defined contribution plan, where the benefit amount is computed based on a formula using contribution and earning credits.

A retirement plan in which the employee and/or the employer contribute to the employee's individual account under the plan. The amount in the account at distribution includes the contributions and investment gains or losses, minus any investment and administrative fees.

Amounts contributed to a plan by the employer at the employee's election and which are excludable from the employee's gross income.

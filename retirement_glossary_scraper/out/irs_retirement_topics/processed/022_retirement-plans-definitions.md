Retirement Plans Definitions
==========================

A retirement plan is an arrangement that provides for the payment of benefits to an individual after they retire from working.

### Types of Retirement Plans

There are several types of retirement plans, including:

*   **Defined Contribution Plan**: A type of plan where the employee and/or employer contribute to the employee's individual account. The amount in the account at distribution includes the contributions and investment gains or losses.
*   **Defined Benefit Plan**: A traditional pension plan that promises a specified monthly benefit at retirement.

### 401(k) Plan

A 401(k) plan is a defined contribution plan where an employee can make contributions from their paycheck either before or after-tax, depending on the options offered in the plan. The contributions go into a 401(k) account, with the employee often choosing the investments based on options provided under the plan.

### 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA) Plan

A 403(b) TSA plan is a retirement plan offered by public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations. An individual's 403(b) annuity can be obtained only under an employer's TSA plan.

### ADP (Actual Deferral Percentage)

ADP is an annual test in a 401(k) plan that compares the average salary deferrals of highly compensated employees to that of nonhighly compensated employees.

### Annual Additions

Annual additions are the total of all employer contributions, employee contributions (not including rollovers), and forfeitures allocated to a participant's account in a year.

### Annuity

An annuity is a series of payments under a contract that are made at regular intervals and over a period of more than one year.

### Cash Balance Plan

A cash balance plan is a type of defined benefit plan that includes some elements that are similar to a defined contribution plan because the benefit amount is computed based on a formula using contribution and earning credits.

### Defined Benefit Plan

A defined benefit plan promises the participant a specified monthly benefit at retirement. Often, the benefit is based on factors such as the participant's salary, age, and the number of years they worked for the employer.

### Defined Contribution Plan

A defined contribution plan is a retirement plan in which the employee and/or employer contribute to the employee's individual account under the plan. The amount in the account at distribution includes the contributions and investment gains or losses.

### Elective Deferrals

Elective deferrals are amounts contributed to a plan by the employer at the employee's election and which, except to the extent they are designated Roth contributions, are excludable from the employee's gross income.

### Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)

ERISA is a federal law that regulates employee benefit plans, including retirement plans.

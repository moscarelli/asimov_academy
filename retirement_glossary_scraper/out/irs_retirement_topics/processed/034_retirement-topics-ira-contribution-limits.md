	+ Total contributions: $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older)

#### Exceptions

#### Income Limitations
The deduction of traditional IRA contributions may be limited based on income levels and coverage by a retirement plan at work.

#### Spousal IRAs
If filing jointly, one spouse can contribute to an IRA even without taxable compensation as long as the other spouse did. However, combined contributions cannot exceed reported joint return compensation.

#### Participating in a Retirement Plan at Work
Contributions are possible but deduction limits may apply for traditional IRA and Roth IRA contributions based on income levels.

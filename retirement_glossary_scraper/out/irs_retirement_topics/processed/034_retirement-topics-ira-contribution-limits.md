### Exceptions to the Contribution Limit

### Roth IRA Contribution Limits

* In addition to the general contribution limit that applies to both Roth and traditional IRAs, your Roth IRA contribution may be limited based on your filing status and income.

### Spousal IRAs

* If you file a joint return, you may contribute to an IRA even if you didn't have taxable compensation as long as your spouse did.
* The total of your combined contributions cannot exceed the taxable compensation reported on your joint return.

### Example Contributions

* John, age 42, can contribute a total of $6,000 to either a traditional or Roth IRA for 2020.
* Sarah, age 50, can contribute $7,000 to her IRA for 2020, while her spouse can also contribute up to $6,000.

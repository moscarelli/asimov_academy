Retirement Topics Loans
==========================

### Overview

Retirement plans may offer loans to participants, but a plan sponsor is not required to include loan provisions in its plan. However, some plans do not offer loans.

### Types of Plans that Offer Loans

*   Profit-sharing plans
*   Money purchase plans
*   401(k) plans
*   403(b) plans
*   457(b) plans

### IRAs and IRA-Based Plans

IRAs and IRA-based plans (SEP, SIMPLE IRA, and SARSEP plans) cannot offer participant loans. A loan from an IRA or IRA-based plan would result in a prohibited transaction.

### Loan Requirements

To receive a plan loan, a participant must apply for the loan and meet certain requirements. The participant should receive information from the plan administrator describing the availability of and terms for obtaining a loan.

### Maximum Loan Amount

The maximum amount a participant may borrow from their plan is 50% of their vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. An exception to this limit is if 50% of the vested account balance is less than $10,000: in such case, the participant may borrow up to $10,000.

### Repayment Periods

Generally, the employee must repay a plan loan within five years and make payments at least quarterly. The law provides an exception to the 5-year requirement if the employee uses the loan to purchase a primary residence.

### Loans to Employees Who Leave the Company or Are in Active Duty

*   Plan sponsors may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if they terminate employment or if the plan is terminated.
*   If the employee is unable to repay the loan, then the employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS on Form 1099-R.
*   The employee can avoid immediate income tax consequences by rolling over all or part of the loan's outstanding balance to an IRA or eligible retirement plan.

### Loans That Do Not Meet Legal Requirements

Loans that exceed the maximum amount or do not follow the required repayment schedule are considered "deemed distributions." If the loan repayments are not made at least quarterly, the remaining balance is treated as a distribution subject to income tax and may be subject to the 10% early distribution tax.

### Loans to Employees in Active Duty

*   The employer may suspend loan repayments during the employee's period of active duty.
*   If the employee takes a leave of absence, their salary may be reduced to the point where repayment is insufficient.

# Retirement Topics: Loans
## Overview

Retirement plans may offer loans to participants, but a plan sponsor is not required to include loan provisions in its plan. These loans are typically available for profit-sharing, money purchase, 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) plans.

## Types of Loans Available
- **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and IRA-based plans**: Cannot offer participant loans.
- **Profit-sharing**, **money purchase**, **401(k)**, **403(b)**, and **457(b)** plans: May offer loans.

## Requirements for Receiving a Plan Loan

To receive a plan loan, a participant must apply for the loan and meet certain requirements. The participant should receive information from the plan administrator describing the availability of and terms for obtaining a loan.

### Maximum Loan Amount
The maximum amount a participant may borrow from his or her plan is 50% of his or her vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. An exception to this limit is if 50% of the vested account balance is less than $10,000: in such case, the participant may borrow up to $10,000.

### Repayment Periods
Generally, the employee must repay a plan loan within five years and make payments at least quarterly.

### Loans to an Employee That Leaves the Company
Plan sponsors may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if he or she terminates employment or if the plan is terminated. If the employee is unable to repay the loan, then the employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS on Form 1099-R.

### Loans That Do Not Meet Legal Requirements
Loans that exceed the maximum amount or do not follow the required repayment schedule are considered "deemed distributions." These amounts are treated as basis and will not be taxable when later distributed by the plan.

### Loans to an Employee in the Armed Forces
If the employee is in the armed forces, the employer may suspend loan repayments during the employee's period of active duty and then extend the loan repayment period by this period.

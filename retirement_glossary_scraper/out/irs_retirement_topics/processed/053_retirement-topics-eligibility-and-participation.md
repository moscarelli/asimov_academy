Retirement topics - Eligibility and participation
==============================

Eligibility
------------

*   Employees must be in their employer's qualified plan (e.g., profit-sharing, 401(k) or defined benefit plan) if they are:
    *   At least age 21
    *   Have at least 1 year of service
*   Other plans may require an employee to accrue 2 years of service before being immediately vested in their accrued benefits

Participation
-------------

*   The employer must follow the eligibility rules stated in the plan document, which can be less restrictive than those listed above.
*   Employees should review the Summary Plan Description given by their employer to determine the eligibility requirements for their plan.

Example: Employer B's plan allows employees to participate in its profit-sharing plan at age 18.

Vesting
-----

*   The law permits each type of plan to have different requirements for participation in the plan.
*   SEP or SARSEP plans require immediate vesting after 1 year of service, while SIMPLE IRA and Qualified plans may require a longer vesting period.

# Retirement Topics - Eligibility and Participation

## Overview

In general, employees must be in their employer's qualified plan (for example, profit-sharing, 401(k) or defined benefit plan) if they are:

* At least age 21 and have at least 1 year of service
* A plan other than a 401(k) plan can require an employee to accrue 2 years of service, but if it does, then the employee is immediately vested in their accrued benefit

## Employer Requirements

The employer must follow the eligibility rules in the plan document, which can be less restrictive than those listed above.

Example: Employer B's plan allows employees to participate in its profit-sharing plan at age 18.

## Employee Eligibility

An employee is eligible to participate in his or her employer's retirement plan when he or she meets certain conditions stated in the plan.

The law permits each type of plan to have different requirements for participation in the plan.

# Preapproved Retirement Plans
## What are Pre-approved Retirement Plans?
A pre-approved retirement plan is a plan sold to employers by a document provider, such as a financial institution or benefits practitioner. The document provider requests IRS approval (pre-approval) of a defined contribution or defined benefit plan document as meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401, 403(a), or 403(b).

## How are Pre-approved Retirement Plans Used?
The pre-approved plan provider then makes the IRS-approved plan available to adopting employers. The IRS also issues opinion letters for prototype IRAs.

## Pre-Approved Plan Program Changes
The IRS pre-approved plan program changed as announced in Revenue Procedure 2023-37.

*   Two types of pre-approved plans: standardized and non-standardized plans.
*   Separate trust document - trust and custodial agreements must be segregated, and the plan must contain a provision that its terms will govern in the case of a conflict (see Defined Contribution LRM #81). The IRS does not review trust documents.

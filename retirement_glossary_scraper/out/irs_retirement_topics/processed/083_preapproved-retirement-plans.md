# Preapproved Retirement Plans | Internal Revenue Service

A pre-approved retirement plan is a plan sold to employers by a document provider, such as a financial institution or benefits practitioner. The document provider requests IRS approval ("pre-approval") of a defined contribution or defined benefit plan document as meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401, 403(a), or 403(b).

# International Issues Affecting Retirement Plans
=============================================

## Overview

International issues affecting retirement plans are an IRS-wide priority. The Office of Employee Plans is focused on addressing existing abuse and preventing abuse going forward.

### Puerto Rico Compliance

Puerto Rico occupies a unique status as a Commonwealth of the United States. It has its own constitution and a system of government very similar to that of most states in the Union.

#### Background

In 1917, Congress granted American citizenship to Puerto Ricans. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico falls under the jurisdiction of most federal laws of the United States. However, significant taxation differences exist.

#### Retirement Plan Qualification

Under ERISA Section 1022(i), sponsors of pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plans created or organized in Puerto Rico with Puerto Rico trusts, are eligible for two types of favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code:

*   ERISA Section 1022(i)(1): Exempts trust income earned in the U.S. from U.S. taxation.
*   ERISA Section 1022(i)(2): Allows sponsors to make an irrevocable election for the plan to comply with all of the Internal Revenue Code's qualification provisions except for the trust situs requirement.

#### Dual-Qualified Plans

"Dual-qualified" plans have U.S. domestic trusts that cover Puerto Rican employees and qualify under both the Puerto Rico Code and the Internal Revenue Code to provide the Puerto Rican participants with favorable tax benefits.

### Forms and Publications

The following forms and publications are relevant to international retirement plan compliance:

*   Form 1040: Individual Income Tax Return

# International Issues Affecting Retirement Plans
## Overview
International issues affecting retirement plans are an IRS-wide priority. The Office of Employee Plans is focused on addressing existing abuse and preventing abuse going forward.

### Puerto Rico Compliance
Puerto Rico occupies a unique status as a Commonwealth of the United States. It has its own constitution and a system of government very similar to that of most states in the Union.

#### General Principles
Basic principles regarding qualification and filing requirements in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the impact of ERISA Section 1022(i), are outlined below:

* Puerto Rican residents pay taxes to the Hacienda and pay no income tax to the United States on income earned in Puerto Rico.
* Social Security taxes apply to residents of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens.
* Retirement plan qualification under ERISA Section 1022(i) provides favorable tax treatment.

#### Rules for Qualification
* If the Puerto Rico plan is exempt under Puerto Rico Code Section 1165 and all of the participants are residents of Puerto Rico, the trust will be treated as exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a).
* A sponsor can make an irrevocable election for the plan to comply with all of the Internal Revenue Code's qualification provisions except for the trust situs requirement.
* "Dual-qualified" plans have U.S. domestic trusts that cover Puerto Rican employees and qualify under both the Puerto Rico Code and the Internal Revenue Code.

#### Amendments
* A retirement plan and any amendments must apply for and receive a letter from the Puerto Rico Hacienda before the plan is qualified under the Puerto Rico Code.
* The Hacienda issued Circular Letter No. 11-10 (as modified by Circular Letter No. 13-02), which describes the statutory changes that must be included in a plan document under the Puerto Rico Code.

#### Effective Dates
* January 1, 2011, and December 10, 2011, are effective dates for the new rules and Technical Amendments.

* Form 1040: Individual Income Tax Return
* Form W-9: Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certification

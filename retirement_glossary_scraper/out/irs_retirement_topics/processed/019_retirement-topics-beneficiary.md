# Retirement Topics - Beneficiary

## Introduction

## Types of Beneficiaries

- **Spouse**: Has more options than non-spouse beneficiaries.
- **Minor Child**: Requires special handling due to their age.
- **Disabled or Chronically Ill Individual**: May have different RMD requirements.
- **Entity Other Than an Individual**: Includes trusts, charities, and other organizations.

* **Keep as an Inherited Account**
* **Take Distributions Based on Life Expectancy**
* **Follow the 5-Year Rule**

### Death After RBD

## Rollover Options

- **Rollover to Owner's IRA**: Transfer funds into owner's individual retirement account.

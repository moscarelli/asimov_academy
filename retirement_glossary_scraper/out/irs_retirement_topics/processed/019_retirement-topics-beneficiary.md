# Retirement topics - Beneficiary

Beneficiaries of retirement plan and IRA accounts after the death of the account owner are subject to required minimum distribution (RMD) rules. A beneficiary is generally any person or entity the account owner chooses to receive the benefits of a retirement account or an IRA after they die.

## How beneficiary RMDs are determined

The factors that affect the distribution requirements for inherited retirement plan accounts and IRAs include:

*   Whether the account owner died after 2019 (the SECURE Act made changes to the RMDs for beneficiaries if the death of the account holder occurred after 2019).
*   The relationship of the beneficiary to the account owner and certain characteristics (spouse, minor child, disabled or chronically ill individual, entity other than an individual)
*   Whether the original account owner died before or after their required beginning date (the first date the original account owner was required to begin taking RMDs).

**Spousal Beneficiary Options**

The spouse of the account owner has more options than non-spouse beneficiaries. The spousal beneficiary's options are:

*   Keep as an inherited account
*   Take distributions based on their own life expectancy, or
*   Follow the 5-year rule
*   Rollover the account into their own IRA

If the death of the account holder occurred after the required beginning date, the spousal beneficiary's options are:

*   Take distributions based on their own life expectancy
*   No 5-year rule available

**Non-Spouse Beneficiary Options**

If the account holder's death occurred prior to the required beginning date (or if the account is a Roth IRA), the non-spouse beneficiary's options are:

*   Take distributions based on their own life expectancy, beginning the end of the year following the year of death, or
*   Follow the 5-year rule

If the account holder's death occurred after the required beginning date, the non-spouse beneficiary may:

*   Take distributions based on the longer of their own life expectancy or the account owner's remaining life expectancy.

**Death of the Account Holder Occurred in 2020 or Later**

If the account holder's death occurred prior to the required beginning date, the spouse beneficiary may:

*   Keep as an inherited account
*   Delay beginning distributions until the employee would have turned 72
*   Take distributions based on their own life expectancy
*   Follow the 10-year rule
*   Rollover the account into their own IRA

If the account holder's death occurred after the required beginning date, the spouse beneficiary may:

*   Keep a

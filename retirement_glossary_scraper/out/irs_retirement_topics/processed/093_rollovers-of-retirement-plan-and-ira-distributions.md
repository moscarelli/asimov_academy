Rollovers of retirement plan and IRA distributions
=============================

**What is a rollover?**
--------------------

A rollover allows you to transfer funds from one retirement account to another without paying taxes on them. This means your money continues to grow tax-deferred.

**Why roll over?**
-----------------

Rolling over a retirement plan distribution saves you from paying taxes on it until you withdraw it from the new plan, and ensures that your money grows tax-free.

**Types of rollovers**
----------------------

There are three types of rollovers:

*   Direct rollover: The payment is made directly to another retirement plan or IRA.
*   Trustee-to-trustee transfer: The financial institution holding your IRA makes the payment directly from your IRA to another IRA or retirement plan.
*   60-day rollover: A portion of a distribution can be rolled over within 60 days.

**Rules and restrictions**
-------------------------

*   You have 60 days from the date you receive an IRA or retirement plan distribution to roll it over to another plan or IRA.
*   The IRS may waive the 60-day rollover requirement in certain situations.
*   You generally cannot make more than one rollover from the same IRA within a 1-year period.

Retirement plans FAQs regarding USERRA and SSCRA
=====================================

### Filing for Individuals

*   **How to file**: File Form W-8BEN-E, Claim of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding.
*   **When to file**: Within 30 days before filing your tax return or within 60 days after the end of each tax year.

### Employer Contributions

1.  **What is the basic rule for employers re-employing veterans?**
    *   Employers must fund pension benefits that a re-employed participant did not receive due to qualifying military service.
2.  **How does that work for profit-sharing or money purchase pension plans?**
    *   Employers must make the non-elective employer contributions that would have been made during the military service period.

### Employee Contributions

1.  **Are there rules for contributory defined benefit plans?**
    *   Rehired veterans who were employed before their military service may be required to contribute to a plan, and any excess contributions are subject to a penalty.
2.  **How long do rehired veterans have to make up elective contributions?**
    *   The time period for making up elective contributions depends on the type of plan and the amount contributed.

### Participant Loans

1.  **Can a plan allow for a suspension of plan loan repayments when the participant is performing military service?**
    *   Yes, but the suspension must be in accordance with ERISA.
2.  **What happens to the loan when the veteran is rehired?**
    *   The loan remains in effect until it is repaid.

### W-2 Reporting

1.  **How should contributions exceeding the current year limit be recorded on the W-2 without appearing to exceed the current year limit?**
    *   Contributions can be reported as a payment made during the year, and the excess amount will be calculated and included in the next year's return.

### Additional Information

*   USERRA is administered by the Department of Labor.
*   A USERRA Resource Guide is available on the DOL.gov/vets website.

Retirement Plans FAQs regarding USERRA and SSCRA
=============================

USERRA and SSCRA are two federal laws that protect the retirement benefits of members of the uniformed services, as well as veterans who are re-employed after serving in the military. The following frequently asked questions provide general information about how these laws apply to retirement plans.

**Employer Contributions**

*   What is the basic rule for employers re-employing veterans?
    Employers must fund pension benefits that a re-employed participant did not receive due to qualifying military service.
*   How does that work for profit-sharing or money purchase pension plans?
    Employers must make the non-elective employer contributions that would have been made during the military service period.
*   How should compensation be calculated for the leave?
    To calculate the amount of the makeup contributions and allocations, assume the rehired employee earned compensation at the same rate they would have received during the military service period (Code section 414(u)(7)). If this is not reasonably certain, use the employee's average compensation during the 12-month period immediately preceding the qualified military service.
*   How long does an employer have to make these makeup contributions?
    The time period for making these contributions will depend on the specific circumstances of the re-employment and the type of pension plan involved.

**Employee Contributions**

*   Are there rules for contributory defined benefit plans?
    Yes, the Department of Labor has issued guidance on how employee contributions should be made in cases where an employee is rehired after serving in the military.
*   How long do rehired veterans have to make up elective contributions?
    The length of time required to make up elective contributions will depend on the specific circumstances of the re-employment and the type of pension plan involved.

**Participant Loans**

*   Can a plan allow for a suspension of plan loan repayments when the participant is performing military service?
    Yes, plans can suspend loan repayments during military service.
*   What happens to the loan when the veteran is rehired?
    The loan will continue to accrue interest while the veteran is on active duty. When the veteran is rehired, they must resume making loan payments.
*   Is there a cap on the interest rate used during the military service period?
    There is no specific cap on the interest rate used during the military service period.

**W-2 Reporting**

*   An employee elects to do employee makeup contributions to his 401(k) and the contributions span a few years. Such makeup contributions exceed the current year 402(g) limit. How should these contributions be recorded on the W-2 without appearing to exceed the current year limit?
    The Department of Labor has issued guidance on how to report employee contributions in cases where they exceed the current year limit.

**Additional Information**

*   USERRA is administered by the Department of Labor, through the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS). Information and a USERRA Resource Guide are available ([www.dol.gov/vets](http://www.dol.gov/vets)).

# Retirement Topics - Tax on Prohibited Transactions

## What is a prohibited transaction?
A disqualified person must pay an initial tax of 15% of the amount involved in a prohibited transaction for each year (or part of a year) in the taxable period. If the disqualified person does not correct the transaction within the taxable period, there is an additional tax of 100% of the amount involved.

## How to calculate the amount involved
The amount involved in a prohibited transaction is the greater of:
- The money and fair market value of any property given
- The money and fair market value of any property received
If services are performed, the amount involved is any excess compensation given or received.

## What is the taxable period?
The taxable period starts on the transaction date and ends on the earliest of the following days:
- The day the IRS mails a notice of deficiency for the tax
- The day the IRS assesses the tax
- The day the correction of the transaction is completed

## How to pay the 15% tax
Pay the 15% tax with Form 5330.

## Correcting a prohibited transaction
A disqualified person who participated in a prohibited transaction can avoid the 100% tax by correcting the transaction as soon as possible. Correcting the transaction means undoing it as much as you can without putting the plan in a worse financial position than if you had acted under the highest fiduciary standards.

# Exceptions to Tax on Early Distributions from Qualified Retirement Plans

## When Are Early Distributions Subject to the Extra Tax?

Early distributions refer to amounts withdrawn from a qualified retirement plan before reaching age 59½. Use Form 5329 to report these distributions, but if you received a distribution meeting an exception without showing it on your Form 1099-R, use this form to indicate the correct exception.

# Hardship Distributions
Retirement plans may allow participants to receive hardship distributions due to immediate and heavy financial needs.

## Immediate and Heavy Financial Need

*   The employer determines a participant has an immediate and heavy financial need based on the plan terms and all relevant facts and circumstances.
*   Consumer purchases (such as a boat or television) are generally not considered an immediate and heavy financial need.
*   A financial need may be immediate and heavy even if it was reasonably foreseeable or voluntarily incurred by the employee.

## Safe Harbor Distributions

*   Under a “safe harbor” in IRS regulations, an employee is automatically considered to have an immediate and heavy financial need if the distribution is for:
    *   Medical care expenses
    *   Costs directly related to the purchase of an employee's principal residence (excluding mortgage payments)
    *   Tuition, related educational fees, and room and board expenses
    *   Payments necessary to prevent eviction or foreclosure on a residence
    *   Funeral expenses
    *   Certain expenses to repair damage to an employee's principal residence

## Limitations on Hardship Distributions

*   The amount of a hardship distribution must be limited to the amount necessary to satisfy the need.
*   This rule is satisfied if:
    *   The distribution is limited to the amount needed to cover the immediate and heavy financial need
    *   The employee couldn't reasonably obtain the funds from another source

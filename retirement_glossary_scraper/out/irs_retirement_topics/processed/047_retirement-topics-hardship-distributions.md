Retirement topics - Hardship distributions
==========================

Although not required, a retirement plan may allow participants to receive hardship distributions. A distribution from a participant’s elective deferral account can only be made if the distribution is both:

*   Due to an **immediate and heavy financial need**
*   Limited to the **amount necessary** to satisfy that financial need.

Immediate and Heavy Financial Need
---------------------------------

The employer determines a participant has an immediate and heavy financial need based on the plan terms and all relevant facts and circumstances. Consumer purchases (such as a boat or television) are generally not considered an immediate and heavy financial need.

Types of Hardship Distributions
------------------------------

Hardship distributions can be made for:

*   **Medical care expenses** for the employee, spouse, dependents, or beneficiary.
*   **Costs directly related to the purchase of an employee's principal residence** (excluding mortgage payments).
*   **Tuition, related educational fees and room and board expenses** for the next 12 months of postsecondary education for the employee or spouse.
*   **Payments necessary to prevent the eviction of the employee from their principal residence** or foreclosure on the mortgage.
*   **Funeral expenses** for the employee, spouse, children, dependents, or beneficiary.
*   **Certain expenses to repair damage to the employee's principal residence**.

Safe Harbor Distributions
-------------------------

Effective February 23, 2017, 401(k) plans and effective March 7, 2017, 403(b) plans may elect to use the "Summary substantiation method" for six types of hardship distributions. Under a "safe harbor," an employee is automatically considered to have an immediate and heavy financial need if the distribution is for any of these purposes.

Limitations on Hardship Distributions
--------------------------------------

The amount of a hardship distribution must be limited to the amount necessary to satisfy the need. This rule is satisfied if:

*   The distribution is limited to the amount needed to cover the immediate and heavy financial need, and
*   The employee couldn't reasonably obtain the funds from another source.

Employer Responsibilities
-------------------------

Unless the employer has actual knowledge to the contrary, the employer may rely on the employee's written statement that their need can't be relieved from other available resources, including:

*   Insurance or other reimbursement.
*   Liquidation of the employee's assets.
*   The employee's pay, by discontinuing elective deferrals and after-tax employee contributions.
*   Plan loans or reasonable commercial loans.

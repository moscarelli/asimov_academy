# Retirement topics - Divorce
## Overview

If a plan participant gets divorced, his or her ex-spouse may become entitled to a portion of the participant's retirement account balance. The type of plan and amount of benefits determine when and how much the ex-spouse will receive.

## Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDROs)
A court can award all or a portion of participant's retirement plan assets to their spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent by issuing a QDRO. This order must be honored by the plan.

### How to Request a Change

1. Contact your employer or plan administrator to request change of beneficiary forms.
2. Complete those forms in accordance with their instructions and submit them along with a copy of the divorce decree, if requested.

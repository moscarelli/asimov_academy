# A Plan Sponsor's Responsibilities

## Overview

As an employer with a retirement plan in place, you are responsible for ensuring it is operating according to its terms and the law. This includes maintaining compliance with all requirements in the Internal Revenue Code.

## Your Responsibility as a Plan Sponsor

*   Review your plan document annually to ensure it is up-to-date and compliant.
*   Double-check the options selected in your adoption agreement, including eligibility, contributions, vesting, and benefit payment dates.
*   Know what your service agreement does and doesn't cover, including administrative tasks such as reviewing law changes, applying plan terms, giving notices, filing forms, testing, maintaining records, investing funds, and learning about fiduciary responsibilities.

## Correcting Non-Compliance

If your plan becomes non-compliant, you must correct it and pay any associated fees. This may involve communicating with your pre-approved plan provider or plan service provider to address issues such as changes in business, employees, or compensation.

## Maintaining Compliance

*   Communicate regularly with your plan service provider and/or payroll department for tasks such as processing new hires, re-hires, terminations, and compensation changes.
*   Review your service provider's reports, including the allocation report for possible contribution errors and the distribution report to ensure timely required minimum distributions.

## Ongoing Plan Maintenance Responsibilities

*   Keep up with ongoing plan maintenance responsibilities to ensure smooth operation and remaining qualified for tax benefits.
*   Invest plan funds and review associated fees.
*   Learn about your fiduciary responsibilities and correct the plan as needed.

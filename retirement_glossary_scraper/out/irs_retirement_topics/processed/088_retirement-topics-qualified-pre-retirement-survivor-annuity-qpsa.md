# Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA)

## Overview

A QPSA is a form of death benefit paid as a life annuity to the surviving spouse or designated beneficiary.

### Eligibility

To be eligible for a QPSA, you must:

* Be married to the participant
* Be at least 32 years old during the plan year
* Have been a participant in the retirement plan for at least one year

## Types of Plans That Provide a QPSA

Not all qualified plans are required to provide a QPSA. The following types of plans may be exempt:

* Defined contribution plans (other than money purchase or target benefit plans)
* Plans that require the death benefit to be paid in full to the surviving spouse unless consented otherwise
* Plans that do not offer a life annuity option as a form of benefit under the plan
* Plans with direct transfers from another plan, which were required to provide a survivor annuity

## QPSA Notice Requirements

If a retirement plan offers a QPSA, it must give participants a QPSA notice during the period beginning when they are age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year before they turn 35. If an employee becomes a plan participant after turning 35, they will receive a notice within one year of their hire date.

## Reporting Requirements

QPSA information must be reported on Form 1099-R and included in the participant's tax return.

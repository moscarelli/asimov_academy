# Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA)

A QPSA is a form of death benefit paid as a life annuity to the surviving spouse or a designated beneficiary. The rules that apply to survivor benefit payments are:

*   Incidental benefit rule: Death and other non-retirement benefits must be incidental to the primary purpose of the plan.
*   Minimum distribution requirements: Payment of survivor benefits to a non-spouse beneficiary must follow either the 5-year rule or the life expectancy rule.

**Participant Requirements**

*   If a participant gets married, they should immediately notify their employer and/or retirement plan administrator.
*   If a participant gets divorced, they may be required to treat their former spouse as a current spouse under the terms of the divorce and pursuant to a QDRO.
*   A participant who wants to change the beneficiary of any survivor benefits not covered by a QDRO should contact the retirement plan administrator.

**Qualified Plans**

*   A qualified plan must provide a QPSA to all married participants unless they consent in writing to waive it.
*   The consent can be provided at any time after the participant becomes eligible to participate in the plan up to the date of their death.
*   Plans must require a plan representative or notary witness the spouse's consent.

**Exemptions**

*   Some types of qualified plans may be exempt from providing a QPSA if they meet specific criteria, such as:
    *   Defined contribution plans
    *   Plans that do not offer a life annuity option
    *   Plans with direct transfers from another plan

**Notice Requirements**

*   A retirement plan offering a QPSA must give participants a QPSA notice during the period beginning when they are age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year before they turn 35.

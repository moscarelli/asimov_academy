Tax Information for Terminated Employees
=====================================

If you're leaving your job, you have four options for your account balance:

### Option 1: Leave your money in the plan

*   Consider rolling over the balance to an IRA if it's less than $5,000.
*   The plan may require you to move the balance.

### Option 2: Rollover to a new employer's plan

*   Check if the new plan allows you to move the balance from your old plan.
*   Consider factors such as investment options and fees.

### Option 3: Withdraw the balance

*   You'll likely have to pay income tax on any previously untaxed amount that you receive.
*   There may be an additional 10% early distribution tax if you're not at least age 55 (59½, if from a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan).

### Option 4: Rollover to an IRA

*   You can roll over the old plan's balance to a traditional or Roth IRA.
*   Most IRAs offer low-cost investment options.

**How to Roll Over a Balance**

There are two ways to move your old plan's balance to a new plan or to an IRA:

1.  Ask the old plan's trustee to directly transfer the balance to your new plan or IRA.
2.  Request a lump-sum distribution of the balance from the old plan and then deposit it into the new plan or IRA within 60 days.

**Important Considerations**

*   The old plan may withhold 20% for federal income taxes from the distributed amount.
*   You'll need to include this withheld amount in your gross income in the year the distribution was made, and you may owe an additional early distribution tax on the withheld amount.

# Termination of Employment in Retirement Plans

## Overview

If you're leaving your job and have a retirement plan (other than a defined benefit pension plan), you generally have four options for your account balance:

1. **Leave your money in the plan**: Consider keeping the balance if:
	* You like the plan's investment options
	* The plan has low fees, or
	* You want to move the balance to a new employer's plan later.
2. **Rollover to a new employer's plan**: Check if the new plan allows you to move the balance from your old plan into the new plan. Consider factors like:
	* Better investment options
	* Lower fees compared to the old plan
	* Consolidating retirement savings into one plan
3. **Withdraw the balance**: Request a lump-sum distribution, but be aware of:
	* Income tax on previously untaxed amount received
	* 10% early distribution tax (25% for SIMPLE IRA plans within two years)
4. **Rollover to an IRA**: Roll over the old plan's balance to a traditional or Roth IRA, which offers low-cost investment options.

## How to Roll Over

There are two ways to move your old plan's balance:

1. Ask the old plan's trustee to directly transfer the balance to your new plan or IRA.
2. Request a lump-sum distribution and deposit the amount into the new plan or IRA within 60 days.

Keep in mind that the old plan usually withholds 20% for federal income taxes from the distributed amount, so you may need to include this amount in your gross income and potentially pay an additional early distribution tax.

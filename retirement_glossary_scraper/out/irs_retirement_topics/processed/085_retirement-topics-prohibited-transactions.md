# Retirement topics - Prohibited transactions

## What is a prohibited transaction?

Prohibited transactions are certain transactions between a retirement plan and a disqualified person. If you are a disqualified person who takes part in a prohibited transaction, you must pay a tax.

### Types of Disqualified Persons

*   The IRA owner's fiduciary
*   Members of his or her family (spouse, ancestor, lineal descendant, and any spouse of a lineal descendant)

## Prohibited Transactions

The following transactions are considered prohibited:

*   Selling property to it
*   Using it as security for a loan
*   Buying property for personal use (present or future) with IRA funds

### Effect on an IRA Account

If an IRA owner or his or her beneficiaries engage in a prohibited transaction, the account stops being an IRA as of the first day of that year. The effect of this is the account is treated as distributing all its assets to the IRA owner at their fair market values on the first day of the year.

### Exceptions

*   Certain transactions are exempt from being prohibited transactions. For example:
    *   If you receive a benefit to which you are entitled as a plan participant or beneficiary (such as a participant loan), this is not considered a prohibited transaction.
    *   The benefit must be on the same terms as for all other participants and beneficiaries.

## Definition of Fiduciary

An IRA fiduciary includes anyone who does any of the following:

*   Exercises any discretionary authority or control in managing the IRA
*   Provides investment advice to the IRA for a fee, or has any authority or responsibility to do so.
*   Has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in administering the IRA.

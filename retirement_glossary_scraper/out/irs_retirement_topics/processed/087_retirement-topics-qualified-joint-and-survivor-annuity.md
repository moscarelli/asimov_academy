# Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)

A QJSA is when retirement benefits are paid as a life annuity to the participant and a survivor annuity over the life of the participant's surviving spouse.

### Types of QJSA

*   **Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)**: The amount paid to the surviving spouse must be no less than 50% and no greater than 100% of the amount of the annuity paid during the participant's life.
*   **Qualified Optional Survivor Annuity (QOSA)**: The amount paid to the surviving spouse is equal to a certain percentage of the amount of the annuity payable during the participant's life.

### Rules for Survivor Benefit Payments

*   **Incidental Benefit Rule**: Death and other nonretirement benefits must be incidental to the primary purpose of the plan.
*   **5-Year Rule**: Payment of survivor benefits to a non-spouse beneficiary is under this rule.
*   **Life Expectancy Rule**: Payment of survivor benefits to a non-spouse beneficiary is under this rule.

### Participant Requirements

*   **Marriage Notification**: A participant who gets married must immediately notify their employer and/or retirement plan administrator.
*   **Divorce Treatment**: A divorced participant may be required to treat their former spouse as a current spouse under the terms of the divorce.
*   **Beneficiary Designation**: A participant can change the beneficiary of any survivor benefits not covered by a QDRO.

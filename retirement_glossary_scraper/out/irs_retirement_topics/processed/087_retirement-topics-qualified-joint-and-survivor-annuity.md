# Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)

A QJSA is when retirement benefits are paid as a life annuity to the participant and a survivor annuity over the life of the participant's surviving spouse.

## Rules for Survivor Benefit Payments

* Incidental benefit rule: payment must be incidental to the primary purpose of the plan.
* Minimum distribution requirements:
	+ Payment under 5-year rule
	+ Payment under life expectancy rule

## Qualified Plan Requirements

A qualified plan like a defined benefit plan, money purchase plan, or target benefit plan must provide a QJSA to all married participants.

## Exemptions

Some plans are exempt from providing a QJSA if they:

* Require the death benefit be paid in full to the surviving spouse unless the spouse consents to another beneficiary
* Do not offer a life annuity option as a form of benefit under the plan
* Do not contain a direct transfer from another plan that was required to provide a survivor annuity

# Retirement Topics 403b Contribution Limits
## Introduction

Contributions to an employee's 403(b) account are limited by two main rules: the limit on annual additions and the limit on employee elective salary deferrals.

### Limit on Employee Elective Salary Deferrals

The limit on elective salary deferrals is $23,000 in 2024 ($22,500 in 2023; $20,500 in 2022; $19,500 in 2021 and 2020). Employees who are age 50 or over at the end of the calendar year can make catch-up contributions of $7,500 in 2024 and 2023 ($6,500 in 2022 and 2021) beyond the basic limit on elective deferrals.

### Limit on Annual Additions

The limit on annual additions (the combination of all employer contributions and employee elective salary deferrals to all 403(b) accounts) is generally the lesser of:

*   $69,000 in 2024 ($66,000 for 2023; $61,000 for 2022; $58,000 for 2021)
*   100% of includible compensation for the employee's most recent year of service

### Catch-ups for Employees with 15 Years of Service

If permitted by the 403(b) plan, an employee who has at least 15 years of service with the same eligible 403(b) employer can have a 403(b) elective deferral limit that is increased by:

*   $3,000
*   $15,000, reduced by the amount of additional elective deferrals made in prior years because of this rule
*   $5,000 times the number of the employee's years of service for the organization, minus the total elective deferrals made for earlier years

### Catch-ups for Employees Age 50 or Over

If permitted by the 403(b) plan, employees who are age 50 or over at the end of the calendar year can make catch-up contributions of $7,500 in 2024 and 2023 ($6,500 in 2022, in 2021 and 2020) beyond the basic limit on elective deferrals.

# Governmental Plans Under Section 401(a)

A governmental plan is an IRC Section 401(a) retirement plan established and maintained for the employees of:
* The United States or its agency or instrumentality,
* A state or political subdivision, or its agency or instrumentality, or
* An Indian tribal government or its subdivision, or its agency or instrumentality (participants must substantially perform services essential to governmental functions rather than commercial activities).

Other types of governmental plans include:

## 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans
457 Deferred Compensation Plans
Certain Grandfathered 401(k) Plans adopted by a governmental entity before May 6, 1986

### Normal Retirement Age

The IRS and Department of Treasury issued Notice 2012-29 to announce their intent to issue guidance on the applicability of Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(a)-1(b) (the 2007 Normal Retirement Age regulations) to IRC Section 414(d) governmental plans.

* The guidance would clarify that governmental plans don't need to have a definition of normal retirement age if they don't provide for in-service distributions before age 62, and
* Expand the age-50 safe harbor rule in the 2007 NRA regulations, which currently applies only for plans in which substantially all of the participants are qualified public safety employees, to also apply to a group substantially all of whom are qualified public safety employees.

Possible approaches to governmental plan guidance

The IRS and Department of Treasury solicited comments in 2012 on possible standards for determining if a retirement plan is a governmental plan under section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and have announced guidance under consideration that would affect normal retirement age rules and extend the effective date of the 2007 NRA regulations.

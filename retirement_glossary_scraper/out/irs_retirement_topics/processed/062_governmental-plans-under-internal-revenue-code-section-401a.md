# Governmental Plans Under Section 401(a)

## Introduction
A governmental plan is a type of retirement plan established and maintained for the employees of the United States or its agency or instrumentality, a state or political subdivision, or its agency or instrumentality, or an Indian tribal government or its subdivision, or its agency or instrumentality. 

### Types of Governmental Plans

*   401(a) plans
*   403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plans
*   457 deferred compensation plans
*   Certain grandfathered 401(k) plans adopted by a governmental entity before May 6, 1986.

## Normal Retirement Age

The IRS and Department of Treasury issued Notice 2012-29 to announce their intent to issue guidance on the applicability of Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(a)-1(b) (the 2007 Normal Retirement Age regulations) to IRC Section 414(d) governmental plans.

### Guidance Under Consideration

The guidance under consideration would:

*   Clarify that governmental plans don't need to have a definition of normal retirement age if they don't provide for in-service distributions before age 62.
*   Expand the age-50 safe harbor rule in the 2007 NRA regulations, which currently applies only for plans in which substantially all of the participants are qualified public safety employees.

### Extension of Effective Date

The notice also states the IRS and Treasury's intention to extend the effective date of the 2007 NRA regulations for governmental plans to annuity starting dates that occur in plan years beginning on or after the later of:

*   January 1, 2015
*   The close of the first regular legislative session of the legislative body with the authority to amend the plan that begins on or after the date that is three months after the final regulations are published in the Federal Register.

### Governmental Plan Sponsors

Governmental plan sponsors may rely on Notice 2012-29 for the extension until the 2007 NRA regulations are amended.

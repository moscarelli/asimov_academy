# Retirement Topics - Designated Roth Account

A designated Roth account is a separate account in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan to which designated Roth contributions are made. These contributions are not excluded from gross income and are currently taxed.

### How Designated Roth Contributions Work

*   Eligible employees can designate all or a portion of their elective salary deferrals as after-tax Roth contributions.
*   The amount an employee may designate as a Roth contribution is limited to the maximum amount of elective deferrals for the year.
*   A qualified distribution of designated Roth contributions is excludable from gross income.

### Establishment and Management of Designated Roth Accounts

To establish a designated Roth account, the plan document must be amended to provide:

*   Separate accounts for designated Roth contributions
*   A choice of both pre-tax and Roth elective deferrals
*   That only Roth elective deferrals may be contributed to the designated Roth account (not profit-sharing or employer matching contributions or forfeitures)

### Tax Treatment of Designated Roth Contributions

Designated Roth contributions are treated the same as pre-tax elective deferrals for many purposes, including:

*   Annual contribution limits
*   Nonforfeitability and distribution restrictions
*   Nondiscrimination testing
*   Required minimum distributions
*   Calculation of the plan's deduction limits under Internal Revenue Code Section 404

# Choosing a Retirement Plan: Money Purchase Plan

## Overview of Money Purchase Plans

Money purchase plans have required contributions. The employer is required to make a contribution to the plan each year for the plan participants.

## How it Works

With a money purchase plan, the plan states the contribution percentage that is required. For example, let’s say that your money purchase plan has a contribution of 5% of each eligible employee’s pay. You, as the employer, need to make a contribution of 5% of each eligible employee’s pay to their separate account. A participant’s benefit is based on the amount of contributions to their account and the gains or losses associated with the account at the time of retirement.

## Types of Money Purchase Plans

That type of arrangement is different than a profit-sharing plan. With the profit-sharing plan, you, the employer, can decide that you’ll contribute a certain amount, say $10,000. Then, depending on the plan’s contribution formula, you allocate that $10,000 to the separate accounts of the eligible employees.

## Pros and Cons

Possible to grow larger account balances than under some other arrangements.
Administrative costs may be higher than under more basic arrangements.
Need to test that benefits do not discriminate in favor of the highly compensated employees.
An excise tax applies if the minimum contribution requirement is not satisfied.

Choosing a Retirement Plan: Money Purchase Plan
=============================================

A money purchase plan is a type of retirement plan that requires employee contributions and has a fixed contribution percentage. The employer's contribution is also required, which must be made to the participant's separate account.

**How it Works**

In a money purchase plan, the plan states the contribution percentage that is required. For example, if your plan has a 5% contribution requirement, you as the employer must make a contribution of 5% of each eligible employee's pay to their separate account. A participant's benefit is based on the amount of contributions to their account and the gains or losses associated with the account at the time of retirement.

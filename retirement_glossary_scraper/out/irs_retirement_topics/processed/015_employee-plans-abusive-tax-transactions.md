# Employee Plans Abusive Tax Transactions
The IRS is engaged in extensive efforts to curb abusive tax shelter schemes and transactions. The Tax-Exempt and Government Entities division of the IRS participates in this effort by devoting substantial resources to identify, analyze, and examine abusive tax shelter schemes and promotions.

## Background
The IRS finalized regulations on abusive tax shelters. A "listed transaction" is a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, one that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by IRS notice or other form of published guidance.

### Deductions for Excess Life Insurance in Section 412(i) Plans

*   The Treasury Department and the IRS issued guidance to shut down abuses involving the use of certain specially designed life insurance policies in retirement plans.
*   These special policies are made available only to highly compensated employees.
*   They address situations where these special policies are used to artificially increase the deductible contributions to retirement plans while greatly reducing the amount taxable when the policies are distributed to the plan participant.

### Springing Cash Value Insurance Contract

*   If a life insurance contract is transferred from an employer or a tax-qualified plan to an employee, it must be taxed at its full fair market value.
*   Some firms have promoted an arrangement where an employer establishes a qualified plan and the contributions made to the plan are used to purchase a specially designed life insurance contract.
*   The cash surrender value (CSV) of the insurance contract is temporarily depressed, so that it is significantly below the premiums paid.

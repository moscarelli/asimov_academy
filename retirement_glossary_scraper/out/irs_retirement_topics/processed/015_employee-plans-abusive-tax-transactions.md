# Employee Plans Abusive Tax Transactions
## Overview

The IRS is engaged in extensive efforts to curb abusive tax shelter schemes and transactions. This page provides information on listed transactions involving employee benefit plans.

### Background

The IRS finalized regulations on abusive tax shelters. A "listed transaction" is a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, one that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by IRS notice or other form of published guidance.

### Identified Transactions

The following transactions involving employee benefit plans have been identified as listed transactions or abusive transactions:

* Deductions for excess life insurance in Section 412(i) or other defined benefit plans
* Plans with high premiums for life insurance and/or annuity contracts that would (absent surrender charges) exceed the amount needed to provide the benefits set forth in the plan

### Reporting Abusive Transactions

Taxpayers must disclose listed transactions by filing a disclosure statement (Form 8886) with their tax return. Tax-exempt entities should use Form 8886-T.

### Penalties for Failure to Disclose

Penalties will be imposed if there is a failure to disclose a reportable transaction.

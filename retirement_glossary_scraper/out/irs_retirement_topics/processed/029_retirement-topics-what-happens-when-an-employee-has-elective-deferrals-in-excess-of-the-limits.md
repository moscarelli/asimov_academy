# What happens when an employee has elective deferrals in excess of the limits?

If an employee's total deferrals are more than the limit for that year, they should notify their plan and ask that the difference (called an excess deferral) be paid out. The plan must pay the excess by April 15 of the following year or an earlier date specified in the plan.

## Excess withdrawn by April 15

*   If withdrawn by April 15, the amount is not reported again as part of gross income for the year.
*   Income earned on withdrawal is reported as gross income for the tax year it's withdrawn.

## Excess not withdrawn by April 15

*   The excess is taxable in the year of deferral but is not included in cost basis when figuring taxable amount of any eventual benefits or distributions under the plan.
*   An excess deferral left in the plan is taxed twice (once when contributed and again when distributed).
*   If entire deferral stays in the plan, the plan may not be a qualified plan.

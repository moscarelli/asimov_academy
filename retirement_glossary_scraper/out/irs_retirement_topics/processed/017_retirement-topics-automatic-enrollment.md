## What is Automatic Enrollment?

Automatic enrollment allows an employer to automatically deduct elective deferrals from an employee's wages unless the employee makes an election not to contribute or to contribute a different amount.

### Types of Automatic Enrollment

#### 1. Basic Automatic Enrollment (ACA)

* Employees are automatically enrolled in the plan unless they elect otherwise.
* Plan document specifies the percentage of wages that will be automatically deducted.
* Employees can elect not to contribute or to contribute a different percentage of pay.

#### 2. Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA)

* Uniformly applies the plan's default deferral percentage to all employees after giving them the required notice.
* May allow employees to withdraw automatic contributions, including earnings, within 90 days of the date of the first automatic contribution.

#### 3. Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA)

* Uniformly applies the plan's default deferral percentage to all employees after giving them the required notice.
* Meets additional "safe harbor" provisions that exempt the plan from annual actual deferral percentage and actual contribution percentage nondiscrimination testing requirements.

## Required Employer Contributions

Pick either:

* Matching contribution: 100% match for elective deferrals that do not exceed 1% of compensation, plus 50% match for elective deferrals between 1% and 6% of compensation.
* Nonelective contribution: 3% of compensation for all participants, including those who choose not to make any elective deferrals.

## Employee Vesting

Employees must be 100% vested in the employer's matching or nonelective contributions after no more than 2 years of service.

## Default Investments

Employers must choose an investment for employees' automatically deducted salary deferral contributions. Defaults can be limited liability investments, such as life-cycle funds or balanced funds (QDIA PDF). Employees must be given an opportunity to change the investment choice.

# Retirement Topics - Plan Assets
## Overview
In this topic, we will discuss the basics of planning assets for retirement.

### Investing Plan Assets

When setting up a qualified plan, employers arrange how the plan's funds will be invested to increase and protect its assets. Although there is no list of approved investments for retirement plans, there are special rules contained in ERISA that apply to retirement plan investments.

In general, a plan sponsor or plan administrator of a qualified plan who acts as a fiduciary is required to exercise the judgment that a prudent investor would use when investing for his or her own retirement.

Certain rules apply to specific plan types. For example, there are different limits on the amount of employer stock and employer real property that a qualified plan can hold, depending on whether the plan is a defined benefit, a 401(k) or another kind of qualified plan.

### Participant-Directed Investments

Certain plans, such as 401(k) plans, permit participant-directed investments. With participant-directed investments, a plan must offer at least three diversified options for investment, each with different risk/return factors, and the participant can choose how to invest his or her account assets in those options.

There are also certain restrictions on investment choices. For example, both participant-directed accounts and IRAs cannot invest in collectibles, such as art, antiques, gems, certain coins or alcoholic beverages. They can invest in certain precious metals only if they meet specific requirements.

### Valuation of Plan Assets at Fair Market Value

Plan assets must be valued at fair market value, not cost. An accurate assessment of fair market value is essential to a plan’s ability to comply with the Internal Revenue Code requirements and Title I of ERISA.

For example, the FMV of assets must be accurately determined to preclude:

* Prohibited transactions
* Exclusive benefit violations under IRC section 401(a)
* Violations of the section 415 limitation on benefits and contributions
* Excess deductions under IRC section 404
* Violations of the IRC section 412 minimum funding requirements, or
* Discrimination violations under IRC section 401(a)(4)

In a profit-sharing, money purchase, or stock bonus plan, the assets’ valuation will determine a participant’s account value, and ultimately, a participant’s distribution.

In a defined contribution plan, Revenue Ruling 80–155, 1980–1 C.B. 84 provides that because amounts allocated or distributed to a participant must be ascertainable, plans must value their trust investments at least once a year, on a specified date, and according to a method consistently followed and uniformly applied.

In a defined benefit plan, the valuation of trust assets will determine if the plan is adequately funded and if the plan’s funding assumptions are reasonable. This, in turn, will affect the employer’s deduction and funding status.

In a defined benefit plan, IRC section 412 requires yearly plan assets valuations for funding purposes. These valuations must be based on reasonable actuarial assumptions. See Treas. Reg. section 1.401–2(b).

# SEP Contribution Limits (Including Grandfathered SARSEPs)

## Overview

SEP contribution limits, including grandfathered SARSEPs, are an important aspect of retirement planning for small businesses and self-employed individuals.

### Contribution Limits

*   **2024:** 25% of the employee's compensation or $69,000
*   **2023:** 25% of the employee's compensation or $66,000
*   **2022:** 25% of the employee's compensation or $61,000
*   **2021:** 25% of the employee's compensation or $57,000
*   **2020:** 25% of the employee's compensation or $57,000

### Grandfathered SARSEPs

For participants in Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP) plans established before 1997, elective salary deferral contributions are limited to:

*   **2024:** $23,000
*   **2023:** $22,500
*   **2022:** $20,500
*   **2020 and 2021:** $19,500

**Catch-up Contributions**

Catch-up contributions are not subject to this limit. The overall contribution limit (including both employer and employee contributions, but excluding catch-up contributions) is the same as the SEP limit, above.

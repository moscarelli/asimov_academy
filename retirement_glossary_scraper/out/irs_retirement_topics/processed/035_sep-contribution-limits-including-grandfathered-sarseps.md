# SEP Contribution Limits (Including Grandfathered SARSEPs)

## What are the SEP contribution limits?

Contributions an employer can make to an employee's SEP-IRA cannot exceed the lesser of:

*   25% of the employee's compensation, or
*   $69,000 for 2024 ($66,000 for 2023, $61,000 for 2022, $58,000 for 2021 and $57,000 for 2020)

## What is the rule for grandfathered SARSEPs?

Participants in Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP) plans established before 1997 were entitled to make elective salary deferral contributions. For these plans that are still in operation, a participant's elective deferral contributions are limited to $23,000 in 2024 ($22,500 in 2023, $20,500 in 2022 and $19,500 in 2020 and 2021) or 25% of their compensation, whichever is less.

## No Catch-up Contributions

Catch-up contributions are not subject to this limit. The overall contribution limit (including both employer and employee contributions, but excluding catch-up contributions) is the same as the SEP limit, above.

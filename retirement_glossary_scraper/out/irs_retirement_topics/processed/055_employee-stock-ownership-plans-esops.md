# Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)

## What is an ESOP?

An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a qualified defined contribution plan that is a stock bonus plan or a stock bonus/money purchase plan, as defined in IRC section 401(a). An ESOP must be designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities and meet certain requirements of the Code and regulations.

## Jurisdiction

The IRS and Department of Labor share jurisdiction over some ESOP features.

### Anti-Cutback Relief

Notice 2013-17 offers relief for certain ESOP amendments that eliminate a distribution option to meet new diversification requirements.

### S Corporation Stock Held by an ESOP - Deductions

An ESOP-owned S corporation cannot deduct retirement plan contributions for ESOP participants.

### Definition of Readily Tradeable Employer Securities

Notice 2011-19 defines when employer securities held by an ESOP are “readily tradeable.”

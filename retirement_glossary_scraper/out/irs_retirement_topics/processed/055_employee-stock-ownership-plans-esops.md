# Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)
## What is an ESOP?
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a qualified defined contribution plan that is a stock bonus plan or a stock bonus/money purchase plan, as described in IRC section 401(a). It must invest primarily in qualifying employer securities and meet certain requirements of the Code and regulations.

# Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)

## What is an IRA?
An IRA is a tax-deferred investment plan that helps you save for retirement.

## Types of IRAs

*   **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible.
*   **Roth IRA**: Contributions are not deductible, but qualified distributions may be tax-free.

## Setting Up an IRA

You can set up an IRA with a:

*   Bank or other financial institution
*   Life insurance company
*   Mutual fund
*   Stockbroker

## Investing Your IRA Assets

The IRS does not approve certain investments for IRAs. Some resources from the Department of Labor can help you get started on investing for your future.

## Contribution Limits

Contribution limits vary depending on age and income. Deduction limits apply to traditional IRA contributions.

## Rollovers
Rollover requirements may be waived in certain circumstances.

## Distributions

Required minimum distributions (RMDs) must be made by April 1 of each year after the initial distribution. RMDs can be calculated using a worksheet.

## Beneficiaries
Spousal and non-spousal beneficiaries may be eligible for IRA benefits.

## Saver's Credit
Individuals may qualify for up to $1,000 in tax credit if they make eligible contributions to an IRA.

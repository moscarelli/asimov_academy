# Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)

## Types of IRAs

*   **Traditional IRA**: A tax-advantaged personal savings plan where contributions may be tax deductible.
*   **Roth IRA**: A tax-advantage personal savings plan where contributions are not deductible but qualified distributions may be tax-free.

### Employer-Sponsored IRAs

*   **SEP (Simplified Employee Pension)**: A Simplified Employee Pension plan set up by an employer. Contributions are made by the employer directly to an IRA set up for each employee.
*   **SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees)**: A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees set up by an employer. Under a SIMPLE IRA plan, employees may choose to make salary reduction contributions, and the employer makes matching or nonelective contributions.

# Retirement topics - Employer merges with another company

## Overview

A merger of two companies can impact retirement plans. This topic explains how a post-merger company may become the new plan sponsor, merge its retirement plan with that of the other company, or terminate its own retirement plan.

## Post-Merger Company Becomes New Plan Sponsor

* If only one company in the transaction had a retirement plan, the new post-merger company may become the sponsor of that retirement plan.
* A new plan sponsor generally does not significantly change the terms of the existing plan and has little impact on existing plan participants.

## Law Requirements for New Sponsor

* The law requires the new sponsor to notify the plan's participants of the new plan sponsor's name and address.

## Group Affected by Post-Merger Company

* The group most affected by the post-merger company becoming the new sponsor would be the employees of the other company in the merger.
* These employees would likely have the opportunity to join that retirement plan as long as they meet the plan's eligibility requirements.

## Plan Mergers

* A retirement plan can merge with another plan.
* Generally, a plan merger cannot violate the anti-cutback rule.
* The merger usually does not have a significant impact on a participant's benefits.

## Terminating a Retirement Plan

* If a company decides to terminate its retirement plan, it generally:
	+ Notifies all plan participants.
	+ Distributes its assets to the plan participants as soon as administratively feasible (generally within one year).
* Upon termination, each employee is 100% vested in their defined benefit plan's accrued benefits and their defined contribution plan's account balance regardless of the plan's vesting schedule.

# Retirement Topics - Employer Merges with Another Company
The purchase of one company by another (merger) can impact the retirement plans maintained by one or both of the companies.

## Post-Merger Company Becomes New Plan Sponsor

*   If only one company in the merger transaction had a retirement plan, the new post-merger company may become the sponsor of that retirement plan.
*   This typically does not significantly change the terms of the existing plan and has little impact on existing plan participants.

## Plan Mergers

*   A retirement plan can merge with another plan without violating the anti-cutback rule, which protects accrued benefits, early retirement benefits, retirement-type subsidies, or optional forms of benefit.
*   Although a plan merger may result in changes to administrative terms, it usually does not have a significant impact on participant benefits.

## Terminating a Retirement Plan

*   If a company decides to terminate its retirement plan, it must:
    *   Notify all plan participants
    *   Distribute assets to plan participants as soon as administratively feasible (usually within one year)
*   Upon termination, each employee is 100% vested in their defined benefit plan's accrued benefits and defined contribution plan's account balance.
*   Individuals who receive benefits upon plan termination must include any untaxed part in their gross income for the year of distribution.

# QDRO: Qualified Domestic Relations Order

A QDRO (Qualified Domestic Relations Order) is a judgment, decree, or order that requires a retirement plan to pay child support, alimony, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant.

## Key Elements of a QDRO
The QDRO must contain the following specific information:

* The names and last known mailing addresses of the participant and each alternate payee
* The amount or percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid to each alternate payee

A QDRO may not award an amount or form of benefit that is not available under the plan.

## Taxation of QDRO Distributions
A QDRO distribution that is paid to a child or other dependent is taxed to the plan participant. However, if a person receiving QDRO payments is either the employee's spouse or former spouse (not as a nonspousal beneficiary), they can roll over tax-free all or part of the distribution.

## Rolling Over QDRO Payments
Individuals may be able to roll over tax-free all or part of a distribution from a qualified retirement plan that they received under a QDRO. This is similar to rolling over a plan distribution and choosing to roll it over.

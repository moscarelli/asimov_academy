# What is the Employee Plans Office and what does it do?

## Overview of the Employee Plans Office

The Employee Plans Office is responsible for ensuring that plan sponsors, individuals, and benefits practitioners understand and comply with the tax law governing retirement plans and IRAs.

## Departments of the Employee Plans Office

*   Determinations: Reviews retirement plan documents to ensure they are written according to the rules.
*   Technical: Provides private letter rulings on certain limited topics to individual requestors.
*   Voluntary Compliance: Administers IRS programs that allow plan sponsors to correct self-identified problems in plan documents or operations.
*   Examinations: Reviews taxpayer books and records to ensure plans provide the promised benefits and comply with all relevant laws.
*   Customer Account Services: Answers account and basic retirement plan-related questions.

## History of the Employee Plans Office

The Employee Plans Office was created in 1974, following enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), to help protect the retirement benefits of employees. Under ERISA, jurisdiction over employee benefit plans is divided among the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

## Coordination among Agencies

Although jurisdiction is divided among the IRS, DOL, and PBGC, ERISA requires them to coordinate their activities.

# Retirement Plan Checkup

Have you had your retirement plan checkup this year?

A retirement plan needs regular care to keep it operating properly. Your plan’s care should include a regular review of your plan's basic operations.

### One-Page Checklists

These one-page checklists are a quick way to start your review. Each checklist links to a Fix-It Guide with tips on how to find, fix and avoid each potential error.

*   [SEP Checklist](link)
*   [SARSEP Checklist](link)
*   [401(k) Plan Checklist](link)
*   [403(b) Plan Checklist](link)

### Sample Checklist Questions

Has your plan document been updated within the past few years to reflect recent law changes?

Are the plan's operations based on the plan document's terms?

Are all eligible employees participating in the plan?

What do your checklist answers mean?

Answering "no" to any of the checklist questions tells you that you may have a mistake in your plan operation. The expanded explanation for each question – the "Fix-it Guide" - gives you an example of how to correct the mistake.

### Common Mistakes

Your checklist answers might uncover the following common mistakes:

*   not covering the proper employees
*   not giving employees required information
*   not depositing employee deferrals timely
*   not depositing employer contributions timely
*   not following the terms of the plan document
*   not limiting employee deferrals and employer contributions to the proper maximum limits

### Correction Programs

The IRS has helpful correction programs structured to provide financial incentives to find and correct mistakes earlier rather than later. You can correct many mistakes easily, without penalty and without notifying the IRS.

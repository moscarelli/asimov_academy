# Determination, Opinion and Advisory Letters

## What are Determination, Opinion and Advisory Letters?

Determination, opinion and advisory letters are official documents issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that provide guidance to employers and other taxpayers on how to comply with tax laws.

### How to Get a Letter

To get a letter, you must first determine if your retirement plan is eligible for a favorable determination letter. To do this:

*   Check if your plan is pre-approved by the IRS.
*   If not, apply for a favorable determination letter through the Employee Plans Determination Letter Program.

### Types of Letters

The IRS issues two types of letters:

*   **Determination Letter**: An official document that confirms whether your retirement plan meets IRS standards.
*   **Opinion or Advisory Letter**: A non-binding document that provides guidance on how to comply with tax laws.

### Benefits of a Determination Letter

Having a determination letter can help you avoid penalties and interest by:

*   Demonstrating compliance with tax laws
*   Providing evidence for audits or investigations
*   Facilitating plan maintenance and administration

### How to Use Your Letter

Once you receive your determination letter, use it to:

*   Maintain accurate records of your plan's compliance
*   Make informed decisions about your plan's operations and funding
*   Demonstrate compliance with tax laws during audits or investigations

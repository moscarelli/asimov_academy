# Rollovers of After-Tax Contributions in Retirement Plans

## Overview

Many savers have made after-tax contributions to a 401(k) or other defined contribution retirement plan. If your account balance contains both pretax and after-tax amounts, any distribution will generally include a pro rata share of both.

## Rollovers to Multiple Destinations

Distributions sent to multiple destinations at the same time are treated as a single distribution for allocating pretax and after-tax amounts.

### Examples:

*   You withdraw $100,000 from your plan, $80,000 in pretax amounts and $20,000 in after-tax amounts. You may request:
    *   A direct rollover of $80,000 in pretax amounts to a traditional (non-Roth) IRA or a pretax account in another plan,
    *   A direct rollover of $10,000 in after-tax amounts to a Roth IRA, and
    *   A distribution of $10,000 in after-tax amounts to yourself.
*   Can I roll over just the after-tax amounts in my retirement plan to a Roth IRA and leave the remainder in the plan? No, you can't take a distribution of only the after-tax amounts and leave the rest in the plan.

## Prior Distribution Rules

Prior to the 2014 guidance, each distribution from a participant’s account contained a pro rata share of both the pretax and after-tax amounts.

### Example:

*   If a participant’s account was 80% pretax, then each distribution or rollover was made up of 80% pretax and 20% after-tax.

## Transition Rules

Taxpayers can use the new rule for distributions on and after September 18, 2014. For distributions prior to September 18, 2014, taxpayers can also use the new rule, except for distributions from designated Roth accounts.

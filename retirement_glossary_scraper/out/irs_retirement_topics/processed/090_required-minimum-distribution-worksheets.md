# Required Minimum Distribution Worksheets

## Introduction

The IRS provides worksheets to help individuals calculate their required minimum distributions (RMDs) from Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).

### Using the Worksheets

Use one of these worksheets to calculate your RMD:

*   **Required minimum distribution worksheet - use this only if your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your IRA and is more than 10 years younger than you**
*   **Required minimum distribution worksheet - for everyone else (use if the worksheet above does not apply)**

# Missing Participants or Beneficiaries

## Overview

Plan sponsors, administrators, and qualified termination administrators (QTAs) may need to locate missing participants or beneficiaries. This is especially true in cases where a plan failure requires payment of additional benefits to terminated participants.

## Methods for Locating Missing Participants and Beneficiaries

In the absence of IRS letter forwarding services, which were discontinued on August 31, 2012, sponsors, administrators, and QTAs may use various methods to locate missing participants and beneficiaries, including:

- Commercial locator services
- Credit reporting agencies
- Internet search tools
- Department of Labor guidelines

## Search Methods Required by the Department of Labor

According to Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2014-01, the minimum steps a fiduciary must take to locate a participant include:

- Sending a notice using certified mail
- Checking the records of the employer or any related plans of the employer
- Sending an inquiry to the designated beneficiary of the missing participant
- Using free electronic search tools

## Distribution Options for a Terminating Plan

If a participant cannot be located, additional distribution options may apply.

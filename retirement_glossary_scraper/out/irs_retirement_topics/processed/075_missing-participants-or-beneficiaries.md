# Missing Participants or Beneficiaries
## Introduction

Plan sponsors, administrators, and qualified termination administrators (QTAs) sometimes need to locate missing participants or beneficiaries. 

## Background

Previously, the IRS provided letter-forwarding services to help locate missing plan participants. However, with the August 31, 2012, release of Revenue Procedure 2012-35, the IRS stopped this letter forwarding program.

## Methods for Locating Missing Participants and Beneficiaries

In the absence of the IRS letter forwarding program, sponsors, administrators, and QTAs can use a variety of methods to locate missing participants and beneficiaries:

*   Commercial locator services
*   Credit reporting agencies
*   Internet search tools
*   Department of Labor guidelines

The minimum steps the fiduciary of a terminated defined contribution plan must take to locate a participant are:
*   Send a notice using certified mail
*   Check the records of the employer or any related plans of the employer
*   Send an inquiry to the designated beneficiary of the missing participant
*   Use free electronic search tools

# IRC 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans

## What is a 403(b) Plan?
A 403(b) plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity or TSA plan, is a retirement plan offered by public schools and certain 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations. Employees save for retirement by contributing to individual accounts. Employers can also contribute to employees' accounts.

## Eligibility
The following employees are eligible to participate in a 403(b) plan:

*   Employees of tax-exempt organizations established under IRC Section 501(c)(3).
*   Employees of public school systems who are involved in the day-to-day operations of a school.
*   Employees of cooperative hospital service organizations.
*   Civilian faculty and staff of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS).
*   Employees of public school systems organized by Indian tribal governments.
*   Certain ministers if they are employed by Section 501(c)(3) organizations.

## Contributions
Contributions to a 403(b) plan can be made in two ways:

*   Employee salary deferrals: employees contribute a portion of their salary to the plan.
*   Employer contributions: employers may also contribute to employees' accounts.

## Investment Options
Investment options for 403(b) plans are limited to those chosen by the employer. However, some plans may offer designated Roth accounts, which allow salary contributed to be taxed currently but is tax-free when distributed.

### Benefits

*   Flexibility in contributions: employees can choose how much to contribute.
*   Investment options: employers can select from a range of investment options.
*   Optional loans and hardship distributions: add flexibility for employees.

### Drawbacks

*   Limited investment options: may have high administrative costs if employer has limited investment options.
*   High administrative costs: some plans may have higher administrative costs than others.

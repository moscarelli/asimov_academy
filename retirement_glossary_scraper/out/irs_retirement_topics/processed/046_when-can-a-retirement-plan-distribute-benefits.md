When can a retirement plan distribute benefits?
=============================================

*   Unless you elect otherwise, benefits under a qualified plan must begin within 60 days after the close of the latest plan year in which you:
    *   Turn 65 (or the plan's normal retirement age, if earlier);
    *   Complete 10 years of plan participation; or
    *   Terminate service with the employer.

Distributable Events
-------------------

The law permits a plan to distribute an account after certain events (distributable events). Different distributable events apply to different types of plans, and different types of contributions or accounts within those plans. The plan is not required to allow distributions for every possible distributable event.

401(k), Profit-Sharing, and Stock Bonus Plans
---------------------------------------------

*   Employee elective deferrals (and earnings, except in a hardship distribution) -- the plan may permit a distribution when you:
    *   Terminate employment (by death, disability, retirement or other severance from employment);
    *   Reach age 59½; or
    *   Suffer a hardship.
*   Employer profit-sharing or matching contributions -- the plan may permit a distribution of your vested accrued benefit when you:
    *   Terminate employment (by death, disability, retirement or other severance from employment);
    *   Reach the age specified in the plan (any age); or
    *   Suffer a hardship

Defined Benefit and Money Purchase Pension Plans
-------------------------------------------------

*   Full accrued benefit -- the plan will set a normal retirement age, which is when you will be eligible to receive (or begin to receive, in the case of annuity or installment payments) your full accrued benefit.
*   Early or phased retirement -- the plan may permit earlier distributions when you:
    *   Turn age 59 1/2 (even if still employed); or
    *   Terminate employment (by death, disability, early retirement or other severance from employment).

Other Plans
-------------

SEP and SIMPLE IRA plans use IRAs to hold participants' retirement savings. You can withdraw money from your IRA at any time.

**Note:** A 10% additional tax generally applies if you withdraw IRA or retirement plan assets before you reach age 59½, unless you qualify for another exception to the tax.

# Approved Nonbank Trustees and Custodians
The IRS maintains a list of entities approved to serve as nonbank trustees or custodians.

## List and Application Updates

We will frequently update this list as other nonbank trustees or custodians are added or removed.

## Background

Nonbank trustees or nonbank custodians (NBT) are described under Treasury Regulation Section 1.408-2(e). An entity that is not a bank (or an insurance company in the case of Archer Medical Savings Accounts and health savings accounts) can request to be a nonbank trustee/custodian by applying in writing and demonstrating that certain requirements will be met.

## Requirements

To apply for approval as a nonbank trustee or custodian, you must demonstrate that your entity meets the following requirements:

*   An application to serve as a nonbank trustee or custodian under Treasury Regulation Section 1.408-2(e)
*   You are not an insurance company
*   The assets held by your entity meet the requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.408-2(e)(2) - (e)(5)(viii)(F)

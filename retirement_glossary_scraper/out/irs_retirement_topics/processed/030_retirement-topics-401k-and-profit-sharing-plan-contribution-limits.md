# Retirement Topics - 401(k) and Profit-Sharing Plan Contribution Limits
## Introduction

Two annual limits apply to contributions:

### Employee Elective Salary Deferrals

*   Limit on employee elective salary deferrals for traditional and safe harbor plans:
    *   $23,000 (2023)
    *   $22,500 (2022)
    *   $20,500 (2021 and 2020)
    *   $19,500 (2019)

### Deferral Limits for 401(k) Plans

*   Limit on employee elective deferrals is subject to cost-of-living adjustments.
*   You aggregate all elective deferrals you made to all plans in which you participate to determine if you have exceeded these limits.

### Catch-up Contributions

*   $7,500 (2023 and 2024 for traditional and safe harbor 401(k) plans)
*   $6,500 (2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 for traditional and safe harbor 401(k) plans)
*   $3,500 (2023 and 2024 for SIMPLE 401(k) plans)
*   $3,000 (2022 - 2015 for SIMPLE 401(k) plans)

### Plan-Based Restrictions on Elective Deferrals

*   Your plan's terms may impose a lower limit on elective deferrals.
*   If you are a manager, owner, or highly compensated employee, your plan might need to limit your deferrals to pass nondiscrimination tests.

## Important Considerations

*   You don’t need to be “behind” in your plan contributions in order to be eligible to make additional catch-up contributions.
*   If you participate in plans of different employers, you can treat amounts as catch-up contributions regardless of whether the individual plans permit those contributions.

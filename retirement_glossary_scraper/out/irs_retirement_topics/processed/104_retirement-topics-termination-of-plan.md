# Retirement Topics - Termination of Plan

## Overview
Since an employer isn't required by law to provide a retirement plan for employees, it can terminate its retirement plan.

## Reasons for Plan Termination
An employer can terminate a plan for various reasons:
- As a result of a voluntary decision to terminate the plan.
- As part of a bankruptcy.
- As part of a transaction where the business is sold to another company or purchases another company (merger).

## Partial Termination
A plan can suffer a partial termination if an employer closes a particular plant or division that results in the termination of employment of a substantial portion (usually 20% or more) of plan participants, or if a defined benefit plan stops or reduces future benefit accruals.

## Participant’s Rights Upon Plan Termination
Upon plan termination, participants must be immediately 100% vested in all accrued benefits. In a 401(k) plan, for example, this means that employer matching and profit-sharing contributions must become fully vested regardless of the vesting schedule in the plan document.

## Distribution of Assets by a Terminating Plan
Generally, an employer is required to distribute assets from a terminated plan as soon as it is administratively feasible, usually within one year after plan termination. Affected participants can generally roll over the distributed money to another qualified plan or IRA.

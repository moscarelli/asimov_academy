# Termination of a Retirement Plan

## Introduction

An employer is not required by law to provide a retirement plan for its employees. As a result, an employer can terminate its retirement plan for various reasons.

## Reasons for Terminating a Retirement Plan

*   Voluntary decision
*   Part of a bankruptcy
*   Part of a transaction where the business is sold or purchases another company (merger)
*   Switching to another type of retirement plan
*   Partial termination (when an employer closes a plant or division, resulting in the termination of employment of a substantial portion of plan participants)

## COVID-19 Relief for Certain Partial Terminations

The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 changed how plan sponsors determine partial terminations during the pandemic. For a plan year that includes the period beginning on March 13, 2020, and ending on March 31, 2021, a plan will not have a partial termination if the number of active participants covered by the plan on March 31, 2021, is at least 80 percent of the number of active participants covered by the plan on March 13, 2020.

## Participant's Rights Upon Plan Termination

Upon plan termination, participants must be immediately 100% vested in all accrued benefits. In a 401(k) plan, for example, this means that employer matching and profit-sharing contributions must become fully vested regardless of the vesting schedule in the plan document.

## Distribution of Assets by a Terminating Plan

Generally, an employer is required to distribute assets from a terminated plan as soon as it is administratively feasible, usually within one year after plan termination. Affected participants can generally roll over the distributed money to another qualified plan or IRA.

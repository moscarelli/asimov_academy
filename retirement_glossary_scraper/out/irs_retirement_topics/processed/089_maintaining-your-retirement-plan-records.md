# Maintaining Your Retirement Plan Records
As an employer sponsoring a retirement plan, you are required by law to keep your books and records available for review by the IRS. Having these records will also facilitate answering questions when determining participants' benefits.

## Which Plan Records Should You Keep?
You should keep the following documents:

*   The plan document (e.g., Form 5305-SEP or 5305A-SEP)
*   Recent amendments
*   Determination and approval letters
*   Related annuity contracts
*   Collective bargaining agreements
*   Trust records, including:
    *   Investment statements
    *   Balance sheets
    *   Income statements
*   Participant records, including:
    *   Census data
    *   Account balances
    *   Contributions and earnings
    *   Loan documents and information
    *   Compensation data
    *   Participant statements and notices

## How Long Should You Keep Plan Records?
You should keep retirement plan records until the trust or IRA has paid all benefits and enough time has passed that the plan won’t be audited.

Maintaining Your Retirement Plan Records
=====================================

As an employer sponsoring a retirement plan, you are required by law to keep your books and records available for review by the IRS.

Keeping Plan Records
-------------------

*   The plan and trust document
*   Recent amendments
*   Determination and approval letters
*   Related annuity contracts and collective bargaining agreements
*   Trust records (investment statements, balance sheets, income statements)
*   Participant records (census data, account balances, contributions, earnings, loan documents, information, compensation data, participant statements, notices)

Length of Record Keeping
-------------------------

You should keep retirement plan records until the trust or IRA has paid all benefits and enough time has passed that the plan won’t be audited.

Providing Records in an Audit
-----------------------------

If you’re audited, you are required to provide complete, accurate records in either paper or electronic format if the IRS requests them during an audit.

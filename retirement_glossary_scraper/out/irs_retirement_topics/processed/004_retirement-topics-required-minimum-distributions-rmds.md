# Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) in Retirement Plans
## Introduction

You cannot keep retirement funds in your account indefinitely. You generally have to start taking withdrawals from your IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, or retirement plan account when you reach age 73.

### When Do RMDs Apply?

The minimum distribution rules discussed below apply to original account holders and their beneficiaries in these types of plans:

*   traditional IRAs
*   SEP IRAS
*   SIMPLE IRAS
*   401(k) plans
*   403(b) plans
*   457(b) plans
*   profit sharing plans
*   other defined contribution plans
*   Roth IRA beneficiaries

## Calculating the Required Minimum Distribution

The required minimum distribution for any year is the account balance as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year divided by a distribution period from the IRS’s “Uniform Lifetime Table.”

### Using Workshops to Calculate RMDs

Worksheets can help determine the payout periods and the amount of your required distribution.

## Required Beginning Date for Your First RMD

*   IRAs (including SEPs and SIMPLE IRAS): April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 73.
*   401(k), profit-sharing, 403(b), or other defined contribution plans: Generally, April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which you:
    *   reach age 73
    *   retire (if your plan allows you to delay taking your RMD until retirement)

### Example

Jodie has decided to retire from their employer on their 73rd birthday, December 31, 2024. The employer’s 401(k) plan allows participants to delay taking RMDs until after they retire. Jodie’s first RMD is due by April 1, 2025, for the 2024 year (based on December 31, 2023, balance in their 401(k) plan). Their second RMD is due on December 31, 2026, for 2025 (based on December 31, 2024, balance). Subsequent RMDs are due on December 31st annually thereafter.

If Jodie also had an IRA, their first RMD from the IRA was due by April 1, 2025, for the 2024 year. Jodie’s RMD from their IRA doesn’t affect the RMD due from the retirement plan.

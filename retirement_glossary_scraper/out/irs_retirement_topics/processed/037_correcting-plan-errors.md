# Correcting Plan Errors

The Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) offers three programs for correcting plan errors:

### Self-Correction Program (SCP)

*   Allows employers to make corrections to their plans and submit the corrected information.

### Voluntary Correction Program (VCP)

*   Requires employers to file Form 14568 with the IRS, along with model schedules and supporting documentation.

### Audit Closing Agreement Program (Audit CAP)

*   Offers a faster correction process for employers who have already filed for an amendment.

### Find Plan Errors

EPCRS helps identify common plan errors that can be fixed right away. Employers can use this information to avoid costly corrections.

### Fix Plan Errors

Employers can follow these steps:

1.  Identify the error and its impact on the plan.
2.  Review IRS guidance and revenue procedures for EPCRS.
3.  File a VCP application with the correct documentation.
4.  Follow up with the IRS to ensure the correction is complete.

### Fix-It Guides

Submission kits are available for employers who need help with the correction process.

### Revenue Procedures

*   Revenue Procedure 2021-30 (effective July 16, 2021)
*   Revenue Procedure 2019-19 (effective April 19, 2019)

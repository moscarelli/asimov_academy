# Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension plan (SARSEP)

A SARSEP is a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan that was established before 1997 and permits employee salary reduction contributions.

## Eligibility Requirements

An eligible employee must meet the following requirements:

*   Has reached age 21
*   Has worked for the employer in at least 3 of the last 5 years
*   Received at least $750 in compensation for 2023 and 2024 ($650 in compensation for 2021 and for 2022; $600 for 2019 and for 2020) from the employer during the year

## Participation Requirements

The following participation requirements must be met annually based on all eligible employees:

*   At least 50% of eligible employees must choose to make employee salary reduction contributions for the year.
*   Had no more than 25 employees who were eligible to participate at any time during the preceding year.

## Termination and Amended Requirements

A SARSEP plan may need to be amended for current law changes. Employers who established SARSEPs prior to January 1, 1997, can continue to maintain them, while new employees of employers hired after December 31, 1996, can participate in the existing SARSEPs.

## Exceptions and Exclusions

An employer can use less restrictive participation requirements than those listed, but not more restrictive ones. The following employees can be excluded from a SEP or SARSEP:

*   Employees covered by a union agreement and whose retirement benefits were bargained for in good faith by the employees' union and the employer
*   Nonresident alien employees who do not have U.S. wages, salaries or other personal services compensation from the employer

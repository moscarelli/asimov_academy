# Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SARSEP)

A SARSEP is a type of simplified employee pension plan that was established before 1997 and meets certain participation requirements.

## Eligibility Requirements

An eligible employee is an individual who:

* Has reached age 21
* Has worked for the employer in at least 3 of the last 5 years
* Received at least $750 in compensation from the employer during the year (or higher amounts for previous years)

Employers can use less restrictive participation requirements, but not more restrictive ones. Nonresident alien employees and those covered by a union agreement are excluded.

## Participation Requirements

A SARSEP plan must meet the following participation requirements:

* At least 50% of eligible employees must choose to make employee salary reduction contributions for the year.
* No more than 25 employees who were eligible to participate at any time during the preceding year.

## Amendments and Termination

A SARSEP plan may need to be amended due to current law changes. Employers can still maintain existing plans, but new employees hired after December 31, 1996, must participate in the existing SARSEPs.

## Forms and Publications

The following forms and publications are related to SARSEPs:

* Form 1040
* Form 4506-T

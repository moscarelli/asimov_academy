# Vesting in Retirement Plans

Vesting in a retirement plan means ownership. This means that each employee will vest, or own, a certain percentage of their account in the plan each year.

## Employee Contributions

An employee's own contributions to the plan (for example, employee elective deferrals deducted from salary) are always 100% vested, or owned, by the employee.

## Employer Contributions

Different vesting requirements apply to employer contributions depending on the type of plan the employer sponsors. 

*   SEP and SIMPLE IRA plans require that all contributions to the plan are always 100% vested.
*   Qualified defined contribution plans (for example, profit-sharing or 401(k) plans) can offer a variety of different vesting schedules that are determined by the plan document.

### Vesting Schedules

There are three main types of vesting schedules:

1.  **Cliff Vesting**: This type of schedule requires employees to be 100% vested after a certain number of years of service, such as one year.
2.  **Graded Vesting**: This type of schedule requires employees to become fully vested over time, with the percentage of ownership increasing each year. For example:
    *   Year 1: 0%
    *   Year 2: 20%
    *   Year 3: 40%
    *   Year 4: 60%
    *   Year 5: 80%
3.  **Long-Term Vesting**: This type of schedule requires employees to be fully vested after a certain number of years of service, such as three years.

## Requirements

All employees must be 100% vested by the time they attain normal retirement age under the plan or when the plan is terminated.

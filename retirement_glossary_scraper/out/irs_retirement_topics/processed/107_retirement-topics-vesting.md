# Vesting in a Retirement Plan

## What is Vesting?

Vesting in a retirement plan means ownership. An employee who is 100% vested in their account balance owns 100% of it and the employer cannot forfeit, or take it back, for any reason.

### Employee Contributions

An employee's own contributions to the plan (for example, employee elective deferrals deducted from salary) are always 100% vested, or owned, by the employee.

### Employer Contributions

Different vesting requirements apply to employer contributions depending on the type of plan the employer sponsors.

*   SEP and SIMPLE IRA plans require that all contributions to the plan are always 100% vested.
*   Qualified defined contribution plans (for example, profit-sharing or 401(k) plans) can offer a variety of different vesting schedules that are determined by the plan document.

### Vesting Schedules

Vesting schedules can range from immediate vesting, to 100% vesting after 3 years of service, to a vesting schedule that increases the employee's vested percentage for each year of service with the employer.

Employers can choose to use different methods of counting service.

#### Example:

*   Employer A sponsors a profit-sharing plan. The plan only has employer contributions, uses a 6-year graded vesting schedule, and counts hours of vesting service based on a calendar year.
*   John began working for Employer A in June 2007 and quit in August 2011. John worked at least 1,000 hours (the minimum number of hours of service required to be credited with a year of service under the terms of the plan) in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.
*   He had 5 years of vesting service and is 80% vested in his account.

### When 100% Vesting is Required

All employees must be 100% vested by the time they attain normal retirement age under the plan or when the plan is terminated.

# Participant-Directed Accounts in Retirement Plans

Participant-directed accounts, also known as self-directed accounts, are plan accounts where participants exercise independent control over the investment of their individual accounts.

## Plan Rules and Requirements

The U.S. Department of Labor has established rules about plans that permit participants to direct their own investments. To relieve the plan trustee of fiduciary duties for investments, such plans must inform participants of that fact and offer at least three diversified investment options with different risk/return factors.

**Key Features:**

* Participants are responsible for the consequences of their investment decisions.
* The plan must provide sufficient information about investment options for informed decision-making.
* Participants' shareholder voting rights and confidentiality measures must be disclosed.
* Plan fiduciaries or designated individuals will provide additional information on request.

## Types of Participant-Directed Accounts

Participant-directed accounts are commonly referred to as self-directed accounts. These plans give participants the freedom to choose their own investments, allowing them to exercise independent control over their account balances.

## Investment Options and Choices

For participant-directed accounts, plan officials must offer at least three diversified investment options with different risk/return factors that participants can choose from. Participants are responsible for making informed decisions based on this information.

## Plan Administration and Compliance

Plan administrators must comply with the rules and regulations governing participant-directed accounts. Failure to do so may result in fiduciary liability.

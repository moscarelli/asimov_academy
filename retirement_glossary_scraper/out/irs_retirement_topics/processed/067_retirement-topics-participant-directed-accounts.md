# Retirement Topics: Participant-Directed Accounts

## What are participant-directed accounts?

Participant-directed accounts, also known as self-directed accounts, allow plan participants to exercise independent control over the investment of their individual accounts.

## Types of participant-directed accounts

There are several types of participant-directed accounts:

*   Defined contribution plans that give participants choices
*   IRAs and other individual retirement accounts

## Rules for participant-directed accounts

The U.S. Department of Labor has established rules about plans that permit participants to direct their own investments. These rules require plan officials to inform participants of the fact that they are relieving themselves of fiduciary duties.

**Key Requirements**

*   Participants must be given sufficient information about investment options
*   Participants are responsible for the consequences of their investment decisions

## Examples of participant-directed accounts

*   **Roth IRAs**: A type of individual retirement account that allows participants to contribute after-tax dollars
*   **Traditional IRAs**: A type of individual retirement account that allows participants to contribute pre-tax dollars
*   **SEP-IRAs**: A type of individual retirement account that allows self-employed individuals to make tax-deductible contributions

# Is my 401(k) top-heavy?

A plan is top-heavy when the owners and most highly paid employees ("key employees") own more than 60% of the value of the plan assets. This ratio is tested every year based on the account balances on the last day of the prior plan year.

## What is a Top-Heavy Plan?

If Key employees' accounts divided by All employees' accounts is more than 60%, then the plan is top-heavy.

## Are Some 401(k) Plans Exempt from Top-Heavy Testing?

Yes. There's no need to do top-heavy testing for a safe harbor 401(k) that receives only elective deferrals and safe harbor minimum contributions, including:

* Matching contributions (up to 4% match)
* Non-elective employer contributions of 3% of salary to every account regardless of whether the employee makes salary deferrals
* Contributions under a qualified auto-enrollment plan (up to 3.5% match, or 3% non-elective)

## Who are Key Employees?

Key employees are officers or owners of your business who at any time during the year before your testing date were:

* Officers making over $220,000 for 2024, $215,000 for 2023, $200,000 for 2022 and $185,000 for 2020-2021 (adjusted annually for inflation)
* Business owners holding more than 5% of the stock or capital
* Owners earning over $150,000 (not adjusted for inflation) and holding more than 1%

## Determining the Top-Heavy Ratio

The top-heavy determination date is the last day of the previous plan year (December 31 for a calendar year plan). Anyone employed for even one hour in the 12 months ending on the testing date should be included. However, if a key employee later becomes a non-key employee, they should be excluded from your test.

## Measuring Compensation and Ownership

Compensation used to measure key employees includes all salaries, bonuses, commissions, taxable fringe benefits such as auto allowances, and elective deferrals, including compensation paid by any related employers. Your plan document will indicate the types of compensation to include.

Family member attribution applies in measuring ownership, meaning a participant must include stock owned by their spouse, children, grandchildren, and parents.

## Excluding Employees from Top-Heavy Calculations

Your top-heavy ratio calculation can leave out some people's account balances:

* Former employees who did not work even one hour during your testing period
* Employees who used to be key employees but no longer met the requirements during your testing period

You may need to make adjustments to the account values before calculating the top-heavy ratio. Add back distributions made to the employee from account duration.

# Is My 401(k) Top-Heavy?

If you're wondering if your company's 401(k) plan is top-heavy, this article will help you understand what that means and how it can affect your employees.

## What is a Top-Heavy Plan?

A 401(k) plan is considered top-heavy when the owners and most highly paid employees ("key employees") own more than 60% of the value of the plan assets. This ratio is tested every year based on the account balances on the last day of the prior plan year.

## Key Employees

Key employees are officers or owners of your business who at any time during the year before your testing date were:

* Officers making over $220,000 (2024), $215,000 (2023), $200,000 (2022), and $185,000 (2020-2021)
* Business owners holding more than 5% of the stock or capital
* Owners earning over $150,000 (not adjusted for inflation) and holding more than 1%

## Determination Date

The top-heavy determination date is the last day of the previous plan year (December 31 for a calendar year plan). Anyone employed for even one hour in the 12 months ending on the testing date should be included.

## Compensation

Compensation used to measure key employees includes all salaries, bonuses, commissions, taxable fringe benefits, and elective deferrals. Your plan document will indicate the types of compensation to include.

## Family Member Attribution

In measuring ownership, a participant must include stock owned by their spouse, children, grandchildren, and parents.

## Exemptions

Some 401(k) plans are exempt from top-heavy testing if they meet certain conditions:

* Safe harbor 401(k) plans that receive only elective deferrals and safe harbor minimum contributions
* Matching contributions up to 4% match
* Non-elective employer contributions of 3% of salary to every account regardless of whether the employee makes salary deferrals
* Contributions under a qualified auto-enrollment plan (up to 3.5% match, or 3% non-elective)

## Account Balance Adjustments

You may need to make adjustments to the account values before calculating the top-heavy ratio. For example:

* Distributions made to the employee from account during testing period
* Amounts paid by related employers for elective deferrals

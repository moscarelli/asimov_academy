# Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA)

## What is a QPSA?
A QPSA is a form of a death benefit paid as a life annuity to the surviving spouse (or a former spouse, child or dependent who must be treated as a surviving spouse under a qualified domestic relations order) of a participant who was vested in his or her retirement plan benefits, died before retirement, and was married to the surviving spouse for at least one year if the plan so provides.

## Eligibility
A QPSA is typically offered by defined benefit plans, money purchase plans, and target benefit plans. However, some types of qualified plans may be exempt from providing a QPSA, such as:

*   Defined contribution plans (other than money purchase or target benefit plans)
*   Plans that require the death benefit to be paid in full to the surviving spouse unless they have consented to another beneficiary
*   Plans that do not offer a life annuity option as a form of benefit under the plan
*   Plans that contain a direct transfer from another plan, which was required to provide a survivor annuity

## Distribution Rules
The rules that apply to survivor benefit payments to any designated beneficiary who is not the spouse are:

*   Incidental benefit rule: The requirement that death and other nonretirement benefits paid by the plan be incidental to the primary purpose of the plan
*   Minimum distribution requirements: Payment of survivor benefits to a non-spouse beneficiary must be under the 5-year rule or the life expectancy rule

## Notification Requirements
A participant who gets married should immediately notify their employer and/or retirement plan administrator. A participant who gets divorced may be required to treat their former spouse as a current spouse under the terms of the divorce and pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.

## Beneficiary Designation
If a divorced participant wants to change the beneficiary of any survivor benefits not covered by a QDRO, they should contact the retirement plan administrator in order to designate a new beneficiary in accordance with the plan's beneficiary designation procedures.

## Notice Requirements
A qualified plan must provide a QPSA notice during the period beginning when he or she is age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year before the participant is age 35, or within one year from when an employee becomes a plan participant if they are hired after age 35.

# Is My 401(k) Top-Heavy?
Is my 401(k) plan top-heavy?

A plan is considered top-heavy when the owners and most highly paid employees (key employees) own more than 60% of the value of the plan assets. This ratio is tested every year based on the account balances on the last day of the prior plan year.

**What is a Top-Heavy Plan?**
A top-heavy plan occurs when the following conditions are met:

* The key employee accounts divided by all employee accounts exceed 60%.
* The employer must generally pay a minimum 3% benefit to the non-key employees if the top-heavy ratio exceeds 60%.

**Key Employees**
Key employees are officers or owners of your business who meet one of the following criteria:

* Officers making over $220,000 for 2024
* Business owners holding more than 5% of the stock or capital
* Owners earning over $150,000 (not adjusted for inflation) and holding more than 1%

**Non-Key Employees**
A non-key employee is anyone who does not meet the criteria for a key employee.

**Determining Date**
The top-heavy determination date is the last day of the previous plan year (December 31 for a calendar year plan). Anyone employed for even one hour in the 12 months ending on the testing date should be included, but if they later become a non-key employee, they should be excluded.

**Compensation**
Compensation used to measure key employees includes all salaries, bonuses, commissions, taxable fringe benefits, and elective deferrals. Family member attribution is also taken into account when measuring ownership.

**Employees Excluded from Top-Heavy Calculations**
The following individuals can have their account balances left out of top-heavy calculations:

* Former employees who did not work even one hour during the testing period
* Employees who used to be key employees but no longer meet the requirements

**Account Balance Adjustments**
Account balance adjustments may need to be made before calculating the top-heavy ratio. These amounts should be added back in.

**Safe Harbor 401(k) Plans**
There are no exceptions for top-heavy testing if your 401(k) plan receives only elective deferrals and safe harbor minimum contributions.

# Maintaining Your Retirement Plan Records
## Introduction

As an employer sponsoring a retirement plan, you are required by law to keep your books and records available for review by the IRS.

### What Records Should You Keep?

*   Plan document
*   Recent amendments
*   Determination and approval letters
*   Related annuity contracts
*   Collective bargaining agreements
*   Trust records (investment statements, balance sheets, income statements)
*   Participant records (census data, account balances, contributions, earnings, loan documents, information, compensation data, participant statements, notices)

### How Long Should You Keep Plan Records?

You should keep retirement plan records until the trust or IRA has paid all benefits and enough time has passed that the plan won’t be audited.

### Requirements for Recordkeeping

The Internal Revenue Code, Income Tax Regulations, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, require plan sponsors to keep records of these transactions because they may become material in administering pension law.

### What to Do if You’re Audited?

You are required to provide complete, accurate records in either paper or electronic format if the IRS requests them during an audit.

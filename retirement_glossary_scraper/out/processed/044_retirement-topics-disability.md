# Retirement Topics - Disability

## Introduction

A plan participant may receive a distribution from a retirement plan because he or she became totally and permanently disabled. Even if received before the participant is age 59 ½, it is not subject to the 10% additional tax for early distributions, but must still be reported as income.

## Terms and Conditions

The plan document will specify the terms and conditions that a person must meet to receive disability payments and will give instructions on how to apply for them.

# Retirement Topics - 401(k) and Profit-Sharing Plan Contribution Limits

## Introduction

This page provides information on the contribution limits for 401(k) and profit-sharing plans.

## Employee Elective Deferral Limits

*   The limit on employee elective deferrals (for traditional and safe harbor plans) is: $23,000 ($22,500 in 2023, $20,500 in 2022, $19,500 in 2021 and 2020; and $19,000 in 2019), subject to cost-of-living adjustments.
*   You aggregate all elective deferrals you made to all plans in which you participate to determine if you have exceeded these limits.

## Catch-Up Contributions

*   If permitted by the 401(k) plan, participants age 50 or over can also make catch-up contributions:
    *   $7,500 in 2023 and 2024
    *   $6,500 in 2022
    *   $6,000 in 2019 - 2015 to traditional and safe harbor 401(k) plans
    *   $3,500 in 2023 and 2024
    *   $3,000 in 2022 - 2015 to SIMPLE 401(k) plans

## Plan-Based Restrictions on Elective Deferrals

*   Your plan's terms may impose a lower limit on elective deferrals.
*   If you are a manager, owner, or highly compensated employee, your plan might need to limit your deferrals to pass nondiscrimination tests.

## Additional Information

*   You don't need to be "behind" in your plan contributions in order to be eligible to make these additional elective deferrals.
*   Catch-ups for participants in plans of unrelated employers: If you participate in plans of different employers, you can treat amounts as catch-up contributions regardless of whether the individual plans permit those contributions.

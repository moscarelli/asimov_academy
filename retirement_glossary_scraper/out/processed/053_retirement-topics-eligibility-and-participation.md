# Retirement Topics - Eligibility and Participation

## Overview

In general, employees must be in their employer's qualified plan if they are:

*   At least age 21 and have at least 1 year of service.
*   The plan may require an employee to accrue 2 years of service, but if it does, then the employee is immediately vested in their accrued benefit.

## Employer Requirements

The employer must follow the eligibility rules in the plan document, which can be less restrictive than those listed above.

## Example

Employer B's plan allows employees to participate in its profit-sharing plan at age 18.

## Employee Participation

An employee is eligible to participate in their employer's retirement plan when they meet certain conditions stated in the plan.

# Retirement Topics - Getting Married and/or Having Children

## Overview

After getting married or having children (including adopted and stepchildren), a participant should immediately review, and possibly update, his or her retirement plan beneficiaries. Generally, the retirement plan can only pay benefits to a participant's named beneficiaries upon his or her death.

## Requirements for Changes to Retirement Plan Beneficiaries

Most plans require a married participant to obtain his or her spouse's written consent to change beneficiaries and/or the form in which the plan will pay out benefits.

### Steps to Change Beneficiaries

1.  Contact his or her employer or plan administrator to request change of beneficiary forms.
2.  Complete those forms in accordance with their instructions, including obtaining his or her spouse's signature, if applicable.
3.  Submit the completed and signed forms to the employer or plan administrator.

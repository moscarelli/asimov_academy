# Retirement Topics - Divorce

## Introduction

If you get divorced, your ex-spouse may become entitled to a portion of your retirement account balance.

## How Plans Handle Divorce

Most plans require an ex-spouse to file a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) with the plan administrator before paying any portion of a participant's retirement plan benefits to that ex-spouse. A court can award all or a portion of participant's retirement plan assets to his or her spouse, former spouse, child or other dependent by issuing a QDRO.

## Updating Beneficiaries

To change the beneficiary of your retirement plan after a divorce:

1. Contact your employer or plan administrator to request change of beneficiary forms.
2. Complete those forms in accordance with their instructions.
3. Submit the completed and signed forms to the employer or plan administrator, along with a copy of the divorce decree if requested.

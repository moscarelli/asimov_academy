# Rollovers of After-Tax Contributions in Retirement Plans
## Overview

Many savers have made after-tax contributions to a 401(k) or other defined contribution retirement plan. If your account balance contains both pretax and after-tax amounts, any distribution will generally include a pro rata share of both.

## Example: Distribution from a Retirement Plan

Your account balance is $100,000, consisting of $80,000 in pretax amounts and $20,000 in after-tax amounts. You request a distribution of $50,000. Your distribution consists of $40,000 pretax and $10,000 after-tax.

## Rollovers to Multiple Destinations

Distributions sent to multiple destinations at the same time are treated as a single distribution for allocating pretax and after-tax amounts.

**Notice 2014-54**

*   You can roll over all your pretax amounts to a traditional IRA or retirement plan and all your after-tax amounts to a different destination, such as a Roth IRA.
*   Can I roll over just the after-tax amounts in my retirement plan to a Roth IRA and leave the remainder in the plan?
    *   No, any partial distribution from the plan must include some of the pretax amounts.
*   Can I roll over my after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA and the earnings on my after-tax contributions to a traditional IRA?
    *   Yes. Earnings associated with after-tax contributions are pretax amounts in your account.

## Prior Distribution Rules

Prior to the 2014 guidance, each distribution from a participant's account contained a pro rata share of both the pretax and after-tax amounts.

**Transition Rules**

Taxpayers can use the new rule for distributions on and after September 18, 2014. For distributions prior to September 18, 2014, taxpayers can also use the new rule, except for distributions from designated Roth accounts.

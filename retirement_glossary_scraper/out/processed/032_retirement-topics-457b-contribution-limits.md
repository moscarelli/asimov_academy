# Retirement Topics 457b Contribution Limits

A 457(b) plan's annual contributions and other additions (excluding earnings) to a participant's account cannot exceed the lesser of:

*   100% of the participant's includible compensation, or

Increases to the general annual contribution limit:

*   457(b) plans of state and local governments may allow catch-up contributions for participants who are aged 50 or older.
*   Special 457(b) catch-up contributions, if permitted by the plan, allow a participant for 3 years prior to the normal retirement age (as specified in the plan) to contribute the lesser of:
    *   The elective deferral limit ($23,000 in 2024; $22,500 in 2023; $20,500 in 2022; $19,500 in 2020 and in 2021).

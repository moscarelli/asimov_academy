# Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)

A QJSA is when retirement benefits are paid as a life annuity (a series of payments, usually monthly, for life) to the participant and a survivor annuity over the life of the participant’s surviving spouse (or a former spouse, child or dependent who must be treated as a surviving spouse under a qualified domestic relations order).

## Types of QJSA

There are two types of QJSA:

*   **Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)**: The amount paid to the surviving spouse must be no less than 50% and no greater than 100% of the amount of the annuity paid during the participant’s life.
*   **Qualified Optional Survivor Annuity (QOSA)**: The amount paid to the surviving spouse under a QOSA is equal to a certain percentage (as chosen) of the amount of the annuity payable during the participant’s life.

## Rules for Survivor Benefit Payments

The following rules apply:

1.  **Incidental benefit rule**: Death and other nonretirement benefits payable under the plan must be incidental to the primary purpose of the plan.
2.  **Minimum distribution requirements**: Payment of survivor benefits to a non-spouse beneficiary must comply with the 5-year rule or the life expectancy rule.

## Notification Requirements

*   **Marriage**: A participant who gets married should immediately notify their employer and/or retirement plan administrator.
*   **Divorce**: A divorced participant may be required to treat their former spouse as a current spouse under the terms of the divorce and pursuant to a QDRO. If a divorced participant wants to change the beneficiary of any survivor benefits not covered by a QDRO, they should contact the retirement plan administrator to designate a new beneficiary in accordance with the plan's beneficiary designation procedures.

## Plan Requirements

*   **Qualified plans**: A qualified plan like a defined benefit plan, money purchase plan, or target benefit plan must provide a QJSA to all married participants as the only form of benefit unless the participant and spouse, if applicable, consent in writing to another form of benefit payment.
*   **Consent**: Consent can be submitted to the plan within 90 days of when annuity payments will begin. Plans must require a plan representative or notary witness the spouse's consent.

## Exemptions

Some other types of qualified plans may be exempt from having to provide a QJSA if they:

*   Require the plan’s death benefit be paid in full to the surviving spouse unless the spouse has consented to another beneficiary.
*   Do not offer a life annuity option as a form of benefit under the plan.
*   Do not contain a direct transfer from another plan that was required to provide a survivor annuity.

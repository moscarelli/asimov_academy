# Types of Retirement Plans

## Overview

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offers various retirement plans to help individuals save for their future. This page provides an overview of the different types of retirement plans available.

### IRAs (Individual Retirement Arrangements)

*   **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred.
*   **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but earnings grow tax-free.

### Employer-Sponsored Plans

*   **401(k) plans**: Employee contributions may be matched by the employer, and earnings grow tax-deferred.
*   **SIMPLE 401(k) plans**: A simplified version of traditional 401(k) plans for small businesses.
*   **403(b) plans**: Similar to 401(k) plans but offered to employees of certain tax-exempt organizations.
*   **SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) plans**: Small, self-employed individuals can establish a SEP plan.

## Required Minimum Distributions

*   Starting at age 72, you must take minimum distributions from traditional IRAs and employer-sponsored retirement plans.

# Retirement Plans Startup Costs Tax Credit
## Eligible Employers May Claim a Tax Credit Up to $5,000

Eligible employers can claim a tax credit of up to $5,000, for three years, for the ordinary and necessary costs of starting a SEP, SIMPLE IRA or qualified plan (like a 401(k) plan).

### Qualified Employers
To qualify, you must:

* Have 100 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000 in compensation from you for the preceding year;
* Have at least one plan participant who was a non-highly compensated employee (NHCE); and
* In the three tax years before the first year you’re eligible for the credit, your employees weren’t substantially the same employees who received contributions or accrued benefits in another plan sponsored by you, a member of a controlled group that includes you, or a predecessor of either.

### Credit Amount

If you have 50 or fewer employees who received at least $5,000:

* The credit is 100% of eligible startup costs, up to the greater of:
	+ $500;
	+ The lesser of:
		- $250 multiplied by the number of NHCEs who are eligible to participate in the plan, or
		- $5,000.
If you have 51-100 employees who received at least $5,000:

* The credit is 50% of your eligible startup costs, up to the greater of:
	+ $500;
	+ The lesser of:
		- $250 multiplied by the number of NHCEs who are eligible to participate in the plan, or
		- $5,000.

### Eligible Startup Costs

You may claim the credit for ordinary and necessary costs to:

* Set up and administer the plan, and
* Educate your employees about the plan.

### Tax Credit for Plan Contributions

Small employers can claim a tax credit for plan contributions made to a defined contribution plan, SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan. The tax credit is not available for contributions to employees earning more than $100,000 (for 2023).

For employers with 1-50 employees:

* First plan year: 100% of contribution, up to $1,000
* Second plan year: 100% of contribution, up to $1,000
* Third plan year: 75% of contribution, up to $1,000
* Fourth plan year: 50% of contribution, up to $1,000
* Fifth plan year: 25% of contribution, up to $1,000

For employers with 51-100 employees:

* First plan year: 100% minus 2% for each employee exceeding 50 limit
* Second plan year: 100% minus 2% for each employee exceeding 50 limit
* Third plan year: 75% minus 2% for each employee exceeding 50 limit
* Fourth plan year: 50% minus 2% for each employee exceeding 50 limit
* Fifth plan year: 25% minus 2% for each employee exceeding 50 limit

### No Deduction Allowed

You can’t both deduct the startup costs and claim the tax credit for the same expenses. You aren’t required to claim the allowable credit.

### Military Spouse Employees

Small employers with a defined contribution plan, or a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan that hire a military spouse may be eligible for a tax credit:

* The amount of the tax credit an employer may claim is $200 for employing the military spouse, plus 100% of the contributions made, up to $300.
* The maximum tax credit is $500 and may be claimed for the first three years the military spouse participates.

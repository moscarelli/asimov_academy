# 401(k) Plan Overview

A 401(k) plan is a qualified plan that includes a feature allowing an employee to elect to have the employer contribute a portion of the employee's wages to an individual account under the plan.

## Tax Advantages

Two of the tax advantages of sponsoring a 401(k) plan are:

* Employer contributions are deductible on the employer's federal income tax return to the extent that the contributions do not exceed the limitations described in section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.
* Elective deferrals and investment gains are not currently taxed and enjoy tax deferral until distribution.

## Types Available

There are several types of 401(k) plans available to employers:

### Traditional 401(k) Plans

* Allow eligible employees (i.e., employees eligible to participate in the plan) to make pre-tax elective deferrals through payroll deductions.
* Employers have the option of making contributions on behalf of all participants, making matching contributions based on employees' elective deferrals, or both.

### Safe Harbor 401(k) Plans

* Provide for employer contributions that are fully vested when made.
* These contributions may be employer matching contributions, limited to employees who defer, or employer contributions made on behalf of all eligible employees, regardless of whether they make elective deferrals.

## Important Qualification Rules

To qualify for the tax benefits available to qualified plans, a plan must:

* Contain language that meets certain requirements (qualification rules) of the tax law.
* Be operated in accordance with the plan's provisions.

Rules relating to traditional 401(k) plans require that contributions made under the plan meet specific nondiscrimination requirements. In order to ensure that the plan satisfies these requirements, the employer must perform annual tests, known as the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) and Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) tests, to verify that deferred wages and employer matching contributions do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.

### Additional Types of 401(k) Plans

* SIMPLE 401(k) plans
* Other types of 401(k) plans may also be available, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the employer.

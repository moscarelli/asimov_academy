Tax Consequences of Plan Disqualification
=====================================

When an Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) retirement plan is disqualified, the plan's trust loses its tax-exempt status and becomes a nonexempt trust. This disqualification affects three groups: employees, employer, and the plan's trust.

Consequence 1: General Rule - Employees Include Contributions in Gross Income
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, an employee would include in income any employer contributions made to the trust for their benefit in the calendar years the plan is disqualified to the extent the employee is vested in those contributions. However, there are exceptions.

Exceptions
----------

*   If one of the reasons the plan is disqualified is for failure to meet either the additional participation or minimum coverage requirements and the employee is a highly compensated employee, then they would include all of their vested account balance in their income.
*   Non-highly compensated employees would only include employer contributions made to their accounts in the years that the plan is not qualified to the extent the employee is vested in those contributions.

Consequence 2: Employer Deductions are Limited
---------------------------------------------

Once the plan is disqualified, different rules apply to the timing and amount of the employer's deduction for amounts it contributes to the trust. Unlike the rules for contributions to a trust under a qualified plan, if an employer contributes to a nonexempt employees' trust, it cannot deduct the contribution until the contribution is includible in the employee's gross income.

Reporting Requirements
--------------------

*   Any failure to satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements is considered a failure to meet the minimum coverage requirements.
*   If the sole reason for the plan disqualification is that it fails either the additional participation or minimum coverage requirements, and the employee is highly compensated, they would include any previously untaxed amount of their entire vested account balance in their income.

Important Notes
----------------

*   Pat is a participant in the XYZ Profit-Sharing Plan. The plan has immediate vesting of all employer contributions.
*   In calendar year 1, the employer makes a $3,000 contribution to the trust under the plan for Pat's benefit.
*   In calendar year 2, the employer contributes $4,000 to the trust for Pat's benefit.

Conclusion
----------

Tax consequences of plan disqualification can have significant effects on employees and employers. It is essential to understand the reporting requirements and exceptions to ensure compliance with tax laws.

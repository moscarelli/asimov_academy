# Retirement Plans Definitions

## What are retirement plans?

Retirement plans are designed to help employees save for their retirement by contributing a portion of their income to an individual account. The funds in this account grow over time, providing the employee with a source of income during their retirement.

## Types of Retirement Plans

### 401(k) Plan
A defined contribution plan where an employee can make contributions from their paycheck either before or after-tax, depending on the options offered in the plan.

### 403(b) Tax-Seltered Annuity (TSA) Plan
A retirement plan offered by public schools and certain tax-exempt organizations. An individual's 403(b) annuity can be obtained only under an employer's TSA plan.

## Defined Benefit Plans

### Annual Additions
The total of all employer contributions, employee contributions (not including rollovers), and forfeitures allocated to a participant's account in a year.

### Cash Balance Plan
A type of defined benefit plan that includes some elements that are similar to a defined contribution plan because the benefit amount is computed based on a formula using contribution and earning credits.

## Defined Contribution Plans

### Annuity
A series of payments under a contract that are made at regular intervals and over a period of more than one year.

### Elective Deferrals
Amounts contributed to a plan by the employer at the employee's election, which are excludable from the employee's gross income.

## Other Definitions

### ADP (Actual Deferral Percentage)
An annual test in a 401(k) plan that compares the average salary deferrals of highly compensated employees to that of nonhighly compensated employees.

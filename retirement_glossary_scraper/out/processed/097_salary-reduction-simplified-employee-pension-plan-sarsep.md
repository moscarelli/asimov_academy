# Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension plan (SARSEP)

A SARSEP is a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan that:

## Eligibility Requirements

*   Must be established before 1997.
*   Permits employee salary reduction contributions.

### Participation Requirements

*   At least 50% of eligible employees must choose to make employee salary reduction contributions for the year.
*   Had no more than 25 employees who were eligible to participate at any time during the preceding year.
*   May need to be amended for current law changes.

## Who is Eligible for Participation?

*   Generally, any employee who performs services for your business in three out of the last five years must be included in the SARSEP.
*   Exceptions include:
    *   Employees covered by a union agreement and whose retirement benefits were bargained for in good faith by the employees' union and the employer
    *   Nonresident alien employees who do not have U.S. wages, salaries or other personal services compensation from the employer

### Example 1: Bob's Eligibility

*   Employer X maintains a calendar year SEP.
*   The eligibility requirements are:
    *   An employee must perform service in at least three of the immediately preceding five years.
    *   Reach age 21 and earn the minimum amount of compensation during the current year.
*   Bob worked for Employer X during his summer breaks from school in 2016, 2017 and 2018, but never more than 34 days in any year.
*   In July 2019, Bob turned 21. In August 2019, Bob began working for Employer X on a full-time basis, earning $30,000 in 2019.
*   Bob is an eligible employee in 2019 because he has met the minimum age requirement, has worked for Employer X in three of the five preceding years and has met the minimum compensation requirement for 2019.

### Example 2: John's Eligibility

*   Employer Y writes its SEP plan to provide for immediate participation regardless of age, service or compensation.
*   John is age 18 and began working part-time for Employer Y in 2019.
*   John is an eligible employee for 2019 because he has met the requirements.

## Operating and Maintaining a SARSEP Plan

*   Employers who established SARSEPs prior to January 1, 1997, can continue to maintain them and new employees of the employers hired after December 31, 1996, can participate in the existing SARSEPs.
*   The introduction of SIMPLE IRA plans under Internal Revenue Code Section 408(b) (added to the Code by SBJPA) is intended to fill the need for retirement plans like SARSEPs.
*   States or local governments, any of their political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, or tax-exempt organizations cannot have a SARSEP.

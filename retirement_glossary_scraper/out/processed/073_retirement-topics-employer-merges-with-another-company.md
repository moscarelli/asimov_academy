# Retirement topics - Employer merges with another company
When one company buys another, it can impact the retirement plans they both maintain. This guide explains what happens to each plan's sponsor, employees, and benefits.

### Post-Merger Company Becomes New Plan Sponsor

If only one company in the merger transaction had a retirement plan:

*   The post-merger company becomes the new sponsor of that plan.
*   Typically, this doesn't significantly change existing plan terms for participants.

### Plan Mergers

Retirement plans can merge with another plan. This usually does not reduce or eliminate protected benefits like accrued, early retirement, retirement-type subsidies, and optional forms of benefit. However:

*   Plan mergers may result in changes to administrative terms.
*   These changes typically don't impact a participant's benefits.

### Terminating a Retirement Plan

If a company decides to terminate its plan:

*   It must notify all participants.
*   If allowed, it must distribute assets to plan participants as soon as administratively feasible (usually within one year).
*   Upon termination:
    *   Each employee is fully vested in their accrued benefits and account balance regardless of the vesting schedule.
    *   Individuals receiving benefits from terminated plans may need to include previously untaxed amounts in their gross income for the year of distribution.

# Required Minimum Distributions
## What is a Required Minimum Distribution?
A required minimum distribution (RMD) is the amount you must take from your retirement account each year.

### Calculating Your RMD
Use one of these worksheets to calculate your RMD:

*   **Required Minimum Distribution Worksheet**: Use this if your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your IRA and is more than 10 years younger than you.
*   **Required Minimum Distribution Worksheet (for everyone else)**: Use if the worksheet above does not apply.

### Publications
*   [Publication 590-B](https://www.irs.gov/publications/pub590b): Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
*   [Publication 560](https://www.irs.gov/publications/pub560): Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE and Qualified Plans)

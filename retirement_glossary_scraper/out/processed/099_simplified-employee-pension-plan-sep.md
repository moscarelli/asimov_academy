# Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP)

## Overview

A SEP plan allows employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees. A business of any size, even self-employed, can establish a SEP.

## How it Works

*   An employer sets aside money in retirement accounts for themselves and their employees.
*   The contribution rate must be uniform for all employees.
*   Employees are always 100% vested in (or have ownership of) all SEP-IRA money.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:

*   Easy to set up and operate
*   Low administrative costs
*   Flexible annual contributions – good plan if cash flow is an issue
*   Employer must contribute equally for all eligible employees

### Cons:

*   Contribution limits apply
*   No filing requirements for the employer
*   Employee loans are not permitted
*   In-service withdrawals are allowed, but includible in income and subject to a 10% additional tax if under age 59 1/2

## Establishing a SEP Plan

### Steps:

1.  Choose a financial institution to serve as trustee of the SEP-IRAs.
2.  Execute a written agreement to provide benefits to all eligible employees.
3.  Give employees certain information about the agreement.
4.  Set up an IRA account for each employee.

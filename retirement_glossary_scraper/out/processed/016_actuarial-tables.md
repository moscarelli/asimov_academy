# Actuarial Tables

## Overview

The tax law requires the use of these actuarial tables to value annuities, life estates, remainders and reversions, with certain exceptions. These actuarial tables do not apply to qualified retirement arrangements.

## Interest Rate

When using these tables, you must apply an interest rate equal to "The section 7520 rate", which is 120 percent of the applicable federal mid-term rate in effect for the month when the valuation date falls, rounded to the nearest 2 tenths of a percent. For valuations relating to certain charitable transfers, you may instead elect to use the rate in effect for either of the two months before the valuation date.

## Prior and Current Actuarial Tables

For the period from May 1, 2019, to June 1, 2023, you may rely on either the prior or current tables. 

### Prior Tables
- Derived from mortality experience around the year 2000 (Table 2000CM)
- Apply to valuation dates of May 1, 2009 through May 31, 2023

### Current Tables
- Derived from mortality experience around 2010 (Table 2010CM)
- Reference final regulations effective on June 1, 2023
- Apply to valuation dates of June 1, 2023, and thereafter

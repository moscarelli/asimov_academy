# International Issues Affecting Retirement Plans
## Overview

International issues are an IRS-wide priority. The Office of Employee Plans is focused on addressing existing abuse and preventing abuse going forward.

### Puerto Rico Compliance

Puerto Rico occupies a unique status as a Commonwealth of the United States. It has its own constitution and a system of government very similar to that of most states in the Union.

#### General Principles

*   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by law.
*   Puerto Rican residents pay taxes to the Hacienda and pay no income tax to the United States on income earned in Puerto Rico.
*   Social Security taxes apply to residents of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens.
*   Retirement plan qualification under ERISA Section 1022(i) provides favorable tax treatment for plans created or organized in Puerto Rico with Puerto Rico trusts.

#### Qualification Requirements

*   Under ERISA Section 1022(i)(1), the trust will be treated as exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a) if it is exempt under Puerto Rico Code Section 1165 and all participants are residents of Puerto Rico.
*   ERISA Section 1022(i)(2) provides that a sponsor can make an irrevocable election for the plan to comply with all Internal Revenue Code qualification provisions except for the trust situs requirement.

#### Plan Types

*   "Dual-qualified" plans have U.S. domestic trusts that cover Puerto Rican employees and qualify under both the Puerto Rico Code and the Internal Revenue Code.
*   Plans that cover Puerto Rican employees must apply for and receive a letter from the Puerto Rico Hacienda before qualification under the Puerto Rico Code.

#### Recent Changes

*   A new Puerto Rico Code was enacted on January 31, 2011, with changes generally effective January 1, 2011.
*   Technical Amendments were made to the Puerto Rico Code on December 10, 2011, incorporating several changes to local retirement plan rules.

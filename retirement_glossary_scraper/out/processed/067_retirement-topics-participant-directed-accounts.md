# Retirement Topics: Participant-Directed Accounts

## Introduction

Participant-directed accounts, also known as self-directed accounts, are plan accounts where participants exercise independent control over the investment of their individual accounts.

## What is a Participant-Directed Account?

A participant-directed account is a type of retirement plan that allows plan participants to direct their own investments. This means that instead of having someone else make all the investment decisions for the plan's assets, participants have the freedom to choose how to invest their account balances.

## Types of Participant-Directed Accounts

There are several types of participant-directed accounts, including:

*   **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)**: IRAs are a type of retirement plan that allows individuals to save and invest money on their own behalf.
*   **401(k) Plans**: 401(k) plans are a type of employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary to the plan.

## Benefits of Participant-Directed Accounts

The benefits of participant-directed accounts include:

*   **Increased investment options**: Participants have more control over their investments, allowing them to choose from a wider range of options.
*   **Flexibility**: Participant-directed accounts can be used in conjunction with other retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.
*   **Autonomy**: Participants have the freedom to make their own investment decisions, without having someone else making choices on their behalf.

## Rules and Regulations

There are several rules and regulations that govern participant-directed accounts, including:

*   **The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**: The FLSA requires employers to comply with certain requirements when it comes to retirement plans.
*   **The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)**: ERISA is a federal law that regulates the administration of employee benefit plans, including retirement plans.
*   **The Internal Revenue Code**: The internal revenue code provides guidance on tax-related matters, including retirement savings.

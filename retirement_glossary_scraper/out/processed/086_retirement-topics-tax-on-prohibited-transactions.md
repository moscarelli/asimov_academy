# Retirement Topics - Tax on Prohibited Transactions

A disqualified person must pay an initial tax of 15% of the amount involved for each year (or part of a year) in the taxable period. If the disqualified person does not correct the transaction within the taxable period, there is an additional tax of 100% of the amount involved.

## Amount Involved
The amount involved in a prohibited transaction is the greater of:

*   The money and fair market value of any property given
*   The money and fair market value of any property received
*   If services are performed, the amount involved is any excess compensation given or received

## Taxable Period
The taxable period starts on the transaction date and ends on the earliest of the following days:

*   The day the IRS mails a notice of deficiency for the tax
*   The day the IRS assesses the tax
*   The day the correction of the transaction is completed

## Payment of the 15% Tax
Pay the 15% tax with Form 5330.

## Correcting a Prohibited Transaction
A disqualified person who participated in a prohibited transaction can avoid the 100% tax by correcting the transaction as soon as possible. Correcting the transaction means undoing it as much as you can without putting the plan in a worse financial position than if you had acted under the highest fiduciary standards.

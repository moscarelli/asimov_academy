# Retirement Topics - Prohibited Transactions
Retired plans have rules that govern the transactions between a plan, a qualified employee, and any disqualified person. 
## What are Prohibited Transactions?
A prohibited transaction is when you take part in a transaction with a retirement plan if you are a disqualified person.

### Examples of Disqualified Persons

- You (the owner)
- A member of your family
- Your fiduciary

### Types of Prohibited Transactions

1. **Selling, exchanging or leasing property**
2. **Lending money or extending credit**
3. **Furnishing goods, services, or facilities**

### Examples of Prohibited Transactions

- Borrowing money from it
- Selling property to it
- Using it as security for a loan
- Buying property for personal use with IRA funds

### Who is a Fiduciary?

- Anyone who exercises discretionary authority in managing the retirement plan or controlling its assets.

### Effect on an IRA Account

- If you engage in a prohibited transaction, your account stops being an IRA as of the first day of that year.
- The account will be treated as distributing all its assets to you at their fair market values on the first day of the year.

# Roth IRAs
A Roth IRA is an Individual Retirement Account that, except as explained below, is subject to the rules that apply to a traditional IRA.

You cannot deduct contributions to a Roth IRA. If you satisfy the requirements, qualified distributions are tax-free. You can make contributions to your Roth IRA after you reach age 70½. You can leave amounts in your Roth IRA as long as you live.

The account or annuity must be designated as a Roth IRA when it is set up. The same combined contribution limit applies to all of your Roth and traditional IRAs.

Limits on Roth IRA contributions based on modified AGI

*   2023 - Amount of Roth IRA contributions you can make for 2023
*   2024 - Amount of Roth IRA contributions you can make for 2024

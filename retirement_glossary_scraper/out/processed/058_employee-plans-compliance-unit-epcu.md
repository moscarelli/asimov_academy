# Employee Plans Compliance Unit (EPCU)
A part of the Internal Revenue Service, responsible for enforcing compliance with employee plans and retirement savings.

## Overview

The EPCU works to identify areas of non-compliance and conducts analysis to focus on high-risk cases. Taxpayers are initially contacted by correspondence, but may receive follow-up letters or telephone calls if necessary.

## How it Works

Most issues can be resolved without an on-site examination of the plan's books and records. The EPCU has completed 87 projects/strategies and conducted over 53,000 compliance checks to date.

## Resources

# Vesting in Retirement Plans
## What is Vesting?

Vesting means ownership, and it applies to the percentage of an employee's account balance that they own each year.

## Vesting Schedules

*   Employee contributions are always 100% vested.
*   Employer contributions have different vesting requirements depending on the type of plan:
    *   SEP and SIMPLE IRA plans require all contributions to be 100% vested.
    *   Qualified defined contribution plans, such as profit-sharing or 401(k) plans, offer varying vesting schedules determined by the plan document.

## Vesting Examples

*   Employer A sponsors a profit-sharing plan with a 6-year graded vesting schedule. John began working for Employer A in June 2007 and quit in August 2011. After five years of vesting service, John is 80% vested in his account.
*   All employees must be 100% vested by the time they attain normal retirement age or when the plan is terminated.

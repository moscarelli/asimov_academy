Taxation of Plan Assets at Fair Market Value
==============================================

The Internal Revenue Code requires that plan assets be valued at fair market value, not cost. An accurate assessment of fair market value is essential to a plan's ability to comply with the code requirements and Title I of ERISA.

### Why is Fair Market Value Important?

Fair market value is crucial because it determines:

*   Prohibited transactions
*   Exclusive benefit violations under IRC section 401(a)
*   Violations of the section 415 limitation on benefits and contributions
*   Excess deductions under IRC section 404
*   Violations of the IRC section 412 minimum funding requirements
*   Discrimination violations under IRC section 401(a)(4)

### How is Fair Market Value Determined?

The fair market value of plan assets will determine a participant's account value and ultimately, their distribution. In a defined contribution plan, Revenue Ruling 80–155 provides that since amounts allocated or distributed to a participant must be ascertainable, plans must value their trust investments at least once a year, on a specified date, and according to a method consistently followed and uniformly applied.

### What Happens if Fair Market Value is Not Accurately Determined?

If fair market value is not accurately determined, it can lead to issues with the plan's funding status and the employer's deduction. In a defined benefit plan, IRC section 412 requires yearly plan assets valuations for funding purposes. These valuations must be based on reasonable actuarial assumptions.

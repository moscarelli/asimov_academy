# Benefits of Saving Now

Retirement can last for 30 years or more, and a common rule to follow is that a retiree will need up to 80% of their annual income today to retire comfortably.

The average benefit amount paid monthly by the Social Security Administration is $1,177. 

Advantages of saving for retirement include:

*   Tax on employee and employer contributions is deferred until distributed.
*   Investment gains in the plan are not taxed until distributed.
*   Retirement assets can be carried from one employer to another.
*   Contributions can be made easily through payroll deductions.
*   The Saver's Credit is available.
*   Flexible plan options are available.

Retirement Topics Loans
======================

### Introduction

Retirement plans may offer loans to participants, but a plan sponsor is not required to include loan provisions in its plan.

### Plan Loans

*   Profit-sharing, money purchase, 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plans may offer loans.
*   IRAs and IRA-based plans (SEP, SIMPLE IRA and SARSEP plans) cannot offer participant loans.

To receive a plan loan, a participant must apply for the loan and the loan must meet certain requirements. The participant should receive information from the plan administrator describing the availability of and terms for obtaining a loan.

### Maximum Loan Amount

The maximum amount a participant may borrow from their plan is 50% of their vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. An exception to this limit is if 50% of the vested account balance is less than $10,000: in such case, the participant may borrow up to $10,000.

### Repayment Periods

Generally, the employee must repay a plan loan within five years and must make payments at least quarterly. The law provides an exception to the 5-year requirement if the employee uses the loan to purchase a primary residence.

### Loans to Employees Leaving the Company

Plan sponsors may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if he or she terminates employment or if the plan is terminated. If the employee is unable to repay the loan, then the employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS on Form 1099-R.

### Rollover Options

The employee can avoid the immediate income tax consequences by rolling over all or part of the loan's outstanding balance to an IRA or eligible retirement plan by the due date (including extensions) for filing the Federal income tax return for the year in which the loan is treated as a distribution. This rollover is reported on Form 5498.

### Loans That Do Not Meet Legal Requirements

Loans that exceed the maximum amount or do not follow the required repayment schedule are considered "deemed distributions." If the loan repayments are not made at least quarterly, the remaining balance is treated as a distribution that is subject to income tax and may be subject to the 10% early distribution tax.

### Loans for Employees in the Armed Forces

If the employee is in the armed forces, the employer may suspend the loan repayments during the employee's period of active duty and then extend the loan repayment period by this period. If during a leave of absence from his or her employer, an employee's salary is reduced to the point at which the salary is insufficient to repay the loan, the employer may suspend repayment up to a year.

### Exceptions

Loans to employees in the armed forces have different rules regarding repayment and repayment periods compared to other employees.

# Retirement topics - Bankruptcy of employer

An employer can file different types of bankruptcies: Chapter 11, Chapter 13, or Chapter 7. This article explains how these chapters affect an employer's retirement plans.

## How Bankruptcies Affect Employer Retirement Plans

If an employer files a reorganizational bankruptcy (Chapters 11 or 13), it usually continues to operate under the Bankruptcy Court's protection and may be allowed to reorganize its financial affairs. However, after an employer files a liquidation bankruptcy (Chapter 7), the Chapter 7 trustee obtains control over all assets, liquidates them, closes the business, and terminates retirement plans.

## Protection of Retirement Plan Assets

The law protects participants' retirement plan assets from creditors by requiring them to be kept separate from the employer's assets and held in trust or invested in insurance. This ensures that participants' benefits are not affected by the bankruptcy.

## Bankruptcy Types and Their Effects on Retirement Plans

*   **Chapter 7**: The Chapter 7 trustee liquidates assets, closes the business, and terminates retirement plans.
*   **Chapter 11**: The employer continues to operate under the Bankruptcy Court's protection and may reorganize its financial affairs.
*   **Chapter 13**: Similar to Chapter 11, but with more restrictions on the employer's ability to reorganize its finances.

## Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Insurance

If an employer terminates a defined benefit plan, the PBGC may insure some benefits. The PBGC usually pays benefits after termination up to a certain maximum guaranteed amount.

# Employee Plans Abusive Tax Transactions
The IRS is engaged in extensive efforts to curb abusive tax shelter schemes and transactions. The Tax-Exempt and Government Entities division of the IRS, including the office of Employee Plans, participates in this IRS-wide effort by devoting substantial resources to the identification, analysis, and examination of abusive tax shelter schemes and promotions.

## Listed Transactions - Background

*   **Employee Plans listed transactions**: The IRS finalized regulations on abusive tax shelters.
*   **Disclosure Statement (Form 8886)**: Taxpayers must disclose certain transactions, known as "listed transactions," by filing a disclosure statement with its tax return.
*   **Penalties for Failure to Disclose**: The instructions include an explanation of the penalties if there is a failure to disclose a reportable transaction.

## What are Listed Transactions?

A "listed transaction" is a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, one that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by IRS notice or other form of published guidance. The parties who participate in listed transactions may be required to disclose the transaction as required by the regulations.

## Effect on Employee Plans

These types of transactions affect the plan's ability to correct errors using the Employee Plans compliance resolution system, as discussed below.

## Abusive Transactions Identified by the IRS

The IRS had identified the following transactions involving employee benefit plans as listed transactions or abusive transactions:

*   Deductions for excess life insurance in a Section 412(i) or other defined benefit plan
*   High premiums for life insurance and/or annuity contracts that would (absent surrender charges) exceed the amount needed to provide the benefits set forth in the plan

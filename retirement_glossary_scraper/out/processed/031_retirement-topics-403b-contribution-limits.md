Retirement Topics 403b Contribution Limits
=============================================

**Overview**

Contributions to an employee's 403(b) account are limited by two main rules: the limit on annual additions and the limit on employee elective salary deferrals.

**Limit on Employee Elective Salary Deferrals**

The most an employee can contribute to a 403(b) account out of salary is $23,000 in 2024 ($22,500 in 2023; $20,500 in 2022; $19,500 in 2021 and 2020). Employees who are age 50 or over at the end of the calendar year can also make catch-up contributions of $7,500 in 2024 and 2023 ($6,500 in 2022 and 2021) beyond the basic limit on elective deferrals.

**Limit on Annual Additions**

The limit on annual additions (the combination of all employer contributions and employee elective salary deferrals to all 403(b) accounts) is generally the lesser of:

* $69,000 in 2024 ($66,000 for 2023; $61,000 for 2022; $58,000 for 2021)
* 100% of includible compensation for the employee's most recent year of service

**Catch-ups for Employees**

Employees who have at least 15 years of service with the same eligible 403(b) employer can make catch-up contributions:

* An elective deferral limit increased by the lesser of $3,000 or $5,000 times the number of years of service
* A maximum employee and employer contribution cap

**Example**

Assume Pat, age 50, has worked as a teacher in the XYZ School District for 15 years; is eligible for the 15 years of service catch-up; and has eligible compensation of $70,000 for 2023. The maximum employee and employer contributions can be made based on these rules.

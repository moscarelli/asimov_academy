# Missing Participants or Beneficiaries

## Overview

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides information on locating missing participants and beneficiaries from retirement plans.

### Why is this necessary?

Plan sponsors, administrators, and qualified termination administrators (QTAs) may need to locate missing participants and beneficiaries due to plan corrections under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS). However, the IRS no longer processes requests for letter forwarding services for lost participants.

## Methods to Locate Missing Participants and Beneficiaries

In the absence of the IRS's letter-forwarding program, sponsors, administrators, and QTAs can use the following methods:

- Commercial locator services
- Credit reporting agencies
- Internet search tools
- Department of Labor guidelines

The Department of Labor requires fiduciaries of terminated defined contribution plans to take certain steps when searching for missing participants.

### Steps for Searching Missing Participants

1. Send a notice using certified mail.
2. Check the records of the employer or any related plans of the employer.
3. Send an inquiry to the designated beneficiary of the missing participant.
4. Use free electronic search tools.

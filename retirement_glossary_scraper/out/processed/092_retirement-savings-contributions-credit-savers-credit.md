# Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit)

The Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit) is a tax credit for individuals who make contributions to an IRA or an employer-sponsored retirement plan.

## Who's Eligible?

To be eligible for the Saver's Credit, you must:

* Be at least 18 years old
* Not claimed as a dependent on another person's return
* Not a student (defined as enrolled in school for at least five calendar months of the tax year)

## How to Calculate Your Credit

The amount of your credit depends on your adjusted gross income reported on your Form 1040 series return. You can use the chart below to calculate your credit:

| AGI | Credit Rate |
| --- | --- |
| $46,000 or less | 50% of contribution |
| $34,500 - $46,000 | 20% of contribution |
| $23,000 - $34,500 | 10% of contribution |
| Over $76,500 | 0% |

## Example

Jill, a retail store employee, contributed $2,000 to her IRA in 2021. After deducting her contribution, Jill's adjusted gross income was $39,000. She may claim a 50% credit of $1,000 for her $2,000 IRA contribution.

## Credit Limits and Exceptions

The maximum contribution amount that qualifies for the credit is $2,000 ($4,000 if married filing jointly), making the maximum credit $1,000 ($2,000 if married filing jointly). Rollover contributions do not qualify for the credit. Recent distributions from a retirement plan or IRA may also reduce your eligible contributions.

### Credit Rates by Filing Status

| Filing Status | Credit Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Married Filing Jointly | 50% of contribution (AGI ≤ $46,000) |
| Head of Household | 50% of contribution (AGI ≤ $34,500) |
| All Other Filers | 20% of contribution (AGI ≤ $23,000) |

# Designated Roth Account

A designated Roth account is a separate account in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan to which designated Roth contributions are made.

## What are designated Roth contributions?

Designated Roth contributions are not excluded from gross income and are currently taxed. Qualified distributions from a Roth account, including earnings, are excluded from gross income.

### Eligibility

An eligible employee can designate all or a portion of their elective salary deferrals as after-tax Roth contributions. The amount an employee may designate is limited to the maximum amount of elective deferrals for the year.

### Qualified Distributions

A qualified distribution of designated Roth contributions is excludable from gross income. A qualified distribution is one that is made at least five years after the year of the participant's first designated Roth contribution and is made on or after attainment of age 59½, on account of the participant's disability, or on or after the participant's death.

### Establishing a Designated Roth Contribution Program

A 401(k), 403(b) or governmental 457(b) plan may permit employees to designate some or all of their plan elective deferrals as after-tax Roth contributions. The plan document must be amended to provide:

* Separate accounts for designated Roth contributions
* A choice of both pre-tax and Roth elective deferrals
* That only Roth elective deferrals may be contributed to the designated Roth account

### Tax Treatment of Designated Roth Contributions

Designated Roth contributions are treated the same as pre-tax elective deferrals for many purposes, including:

* Annual contribution limits
* Nonforfeitability and distribution restrictions
* Nondiscrimination testing
* Required minimum distributions
* Calculation of the plan's deduction limits under Internal Revenue Code Section 404.

### Contributing to a Designated Roth Account

Employers may offer employees an opportunity to make after-tax salary deferral contributions to a separate designated Roth account.

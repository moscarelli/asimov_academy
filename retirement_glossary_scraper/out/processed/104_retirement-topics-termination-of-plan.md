# Retirement Topics - Termination of Plan

Terminating a retirement plan is an option available to employers who choose not to provide a plan for their employees.

## Reasons for Terminating a Retirement Plan

An employer can terminate a plan for various reasons, including:

* Voluntary decision
* Bankruptcy
* Transaction involving the sale or purchase of another company (merger)

## Partial Termination

A partial termination occurs when an employer closes a plant or division that results in the termination of employment of a substantial portion of plan participants.

## COVID-19 Relief for Certain Partial Terminations

The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 changed how plan sponsors determine partial terminations during the pandemic. For a plan year that includes the period beginning on March 13, 2020, and ending on March 31, 2021, a plan will not have a partial termination if the number of active participants covered by the plan on March 31, 2021, is at least 80 percent of the number of active participants covered by the plan on March 13, 2020.

## Participant's Rights Upon Plan Termination

Upon plan termination, participants must be immediately 100% vested in all accrued benefits. Participants can roll over the distributed money to another qualified plan or IRA.

## Distribution of Assets by a Terminating Plan

Generally, an employer is required to distribute assets from a terminated plan as soon as it is administratively feasible, usually within one year after plan termination. Affected participants can generally roll over the distributed money to another qualified plan or IRA.

For terminated defined benefit plans with insufficient money to pay all of the benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will guarantee the payment of vested pension benefits up to limits set by law.

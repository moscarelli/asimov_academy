# Retirement Topics - Beneficiary

## Overview

Beneficiaries of retirement plan and IRA accounts after the death of the account owner are subject to required minimum distribution (RMD) rules. The owner must designate the beneficiary under procedures established by the plan.

## Factors Affecting Distribution Requirements

*   **Account Owner's Death**: If the account holder died after 2019, the RMDs for beneficiaries may be affected.
*   **Beneficiary Relationship and Characteristics**: The relationship of the beneficiary to the account owner and certain characteristics (spouse, minor child, disabled or chronically ill individual, entity other than an individual) can affect distribution requirements.
*   **Account Owner's Required Beginning Date**: The first date the original account owner was required to begin taking RMDs can impact distribution requirements.

## Beneficiary Options

### Spousal Beneficiaries

*   If the death of the account holder occurred prior to the required beginning date, spousal beneficiaries have the following options:
    *   Keep as an inherited account
    *   Take distributions based on their own life expectancy, or
    *   Follow the 5-year rule
*   If the death of the account holder occurred after the required beginning date, spousal beneficiaries have the following options:
    *   Take distributions based on their own life expectancy
    *   No 5-year rule available

### Non-Spouse Beneficiaries

*   If the account holder's death occurred prior to the required beginning date (or if the account is a Roth IRA), non-spouse beneficiaries have the following options:
    *   Take distributions based on their own life expectancy, beginning the end of the year following the year of death, or
    *   Follow the 5-year rule
*   If the account holder's death occurred after the required beginning date, non-spouse beneficiaries may:
    *   Take distributions based on the longer of their own life expectancy or the account owner's remaining life expectancy.

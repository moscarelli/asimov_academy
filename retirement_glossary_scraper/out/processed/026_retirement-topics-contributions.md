# Retirement Topics - Contributions
A contribution is the amount an employer and employees (including self-employed individuals) pay into a retirement plan.

## Limits on Contributions and Benefits

There are limits to how much employers and employees can contribute to a plan (or IRA) each year. The plan must specifically state that contributions or benefits cannot exceed certain limits. The limits differ depending on the type of plan.

### IRA Contribution Limits
401(k) and profit-sharing plan contribution limits
SEP contribution limits (including grandfathered SARSEPs)
SIMPLE IRA contribution limits
403(b) contribution limits
457(b) contribution limits
Defined benefit plan benefit limits

## Catch-up Contribution Limits
The basic limit on elective deferrals is $23,000 in 2024, $22,500 in 2023, $20,500 in 2022, $19,500 in 2020 and 2021, and $19,000 in 2019, or 100% of the employee's compensation, whichever is less. Catch-up contributions may also be allowed if the employee is age 50 or older.

### Time for Depositting Elective Deferrals
Employers must deposit employee contributions to the retirement plan's trust or individual accounts as soon as they can reasonably be segregated from the employer's general assets. The Department of Labor provides a 7-business-day safe harbor rule for employee contributions to plans with fewer than 100 participants.

### Employer Contributions
Employer matching contributions.
If the plan document permits, the employer can make matching contributions for an employee who contributes elective deferrals (for example, 50 cents for each dollar deferred).

## Types of Employee Contributions

- **Salary Reduction/Elective Deferral Contributions**: pre-tax employee contributions that are a generally a percentage of the employee's compensation.
- **Designated Roth Contributions**: a type of elective contribution that is currently includible in gross income but tax-free when distributed. 401(k), 403(b) and governmental 457(b) plans can allow them.
- **After-Tax Contributions**: contributions from compensation (other than Roth contributions) that an employee must include in income on his or her tax return.

### Taxation of Employee Contributions

If a plan allows designated Roth contributions, it must also offer pre-tax elective deferral contributions. After-tax contributions are not excluded from income and an employee cannot deduct them on their tax return.

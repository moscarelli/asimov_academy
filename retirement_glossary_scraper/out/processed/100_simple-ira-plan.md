# SIMPLE IRA Plan
A SIMPLE IRA plan allows employees and employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees. It is ideally suited as a start-up retirement savings plan for small employers not currently sponsoring a retirement plan.

## Choosing a SIMPLE IRA Plan
Establish a SIMPLE IRA Plan

* Available to any small business - generally with 100 or fewer employees
* Easily established by adopting a SIMPLE IRA prototype or an individually designed plan document
* Employer cannot have any other retirement plan
* No filing requirement for the employer

## How a SIMPLE IRA Plan Works

### Example 1: Elizabeth's Situation

Elizabeth works for the Rockland Quarry Company, a small business with 50 employees. Rockland has decided to establish a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees and will match its employees' contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 3% of each employee's compensation.

* Employer contribution: $1,500 (3% of $50,000)
* Employee contribution: $2,500 (5% of $50,000)
* Total contribution: $4,000

### Example 2: Austin's Situation

Austin works for the Skidmore Tire Company, a small business with 75 employees. Skidmore has a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees and will make a 2% nonelective contribution for each of them.

* Employer contribution: $800 (2% of $40,000)
* Employee contribution: $0
* Total contribution: $800

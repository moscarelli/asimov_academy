SEP Contribution Limits (Including Grandfathered SARSEPs)
======================================

The IRS sets the following contribution limits for SEP plans:

*   For 2024: $69,000 ($66,000 in 2023, $61,000 in 2022, and $57,000 in 2020-2021)

These limits apply to both employer and employee contributions. However, catch-up contributions are not subject to this limit.

### Elective Salary Deferrals

Participants in SARSEPs established before 1997 can make elective salary deferral contributions up to the lesser of:

*   25% of their compensation
*   $23,000 (as of 2024) ($22,500 in 2023, $20,500 in 2022, and $19,500 in 2020-2021)

Note that catch-up contributions are not subject to this limit.

### Grandfathered SARSEPs

Participants in SARSEPs established before 1997 were entitled to make elective salary deferral contributions. These plans are still operational, and a participant's elective deferral contributions are limited to $23,000 (as of 2024) ($22,500 in 2023, $20,500 in 2022, and $19,500 in 2020-2021), whichever is less.

### Catch-Up Contributions

Catch-up contributions are not subject to the SEP limit. However, they are subject to other limits, such as those set by the IRS for defined contribution plans.

### Correcting Excess Contributions

If you have contributed more than the annual limits to an employee's SEP-IRA, you must correct this mistake.

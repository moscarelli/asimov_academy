# Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) in Retirement Plans
### Introduction

You cannot keep retirement funds in your account indefinitely. You generally have to start taking withdrawals from your IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, or retirement plan account when you reach age 73.

### Exemptions

Roth IRAs and Designated Roth accounts are exempt from RMD rules while the account owner is alive. However, beneficiaries of Roth IRAs or Designated Roth accounts are subject to the required minimum distribution rules.

### Calculating the Required Minimum Distribution

The required minimum distribution for any year is the account balance as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year divided by a distribution period from the IRS’s “Uniform Lifetime Table.”

*   Use a different table if the sole beneficiary is the owner’s spouse who is ten or more years younger than the owner.
*   The following can help determine the payout periods and the amount of your required distribution:
    *   Worksheets to calculate the required amount
    *   Tables to calculate RMD during the participant or IRA owner's life:
        *   Uniform Lifetime Table – for all unmarried IRA owners calculating their own withdrawals, married owners whose spouses aren’t more than 10 years younger, and married owners whose spouses aren't the sole beneficiaries of their IRAs
        *   Table I (Single Life Expectancy) is used for beneficiaries who are not the spouse of the IRA owner
        *   Table II (Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy) is used for owners whose spouses are more than 10 years younger and are the IRA’s sole beneficiaries

### Inherited IRAs

If your IRA or retirement plan account was inherited from the original owner, see "required minimum distributions after the account owner dies," below.

### Required Beginning Date for First RMD

*   IRAs (including SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs): April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 73.
*   401(k), profit-sharing, 403(b), or other defined contribution plan: Generally, April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which you:
    *   Reach age 73
    *   Retire (if your plan allows you to delay taking your RMD until retirement).

### Example

Jodie has decided to retire from their employer on their 73rd birthday, December 31, 2024. The employer’s 401(k) plan allows participants to delay taking RMDs until after they retire. Jodie’s first RMD is due by April 1, 2025, for the 2024 year (based on December 31, 2023, balance in their 401(k) plan). Their second RMD is due on December 31, 2026, for 2025 (based on December 31, 2024, balance).

Jodie’s RMD from their IRA doesn’t affect the RMD due from the retirement plan.

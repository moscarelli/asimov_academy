Substantially Equal Periodic Payments
=========================

What is a Substantially Equal Periodic Payment (SoSEP)?
------------------------------------------

A Substantially Equal Periodic Payment (SoSEP) is a distribution of assets from a retirement plan that meets specific requirements. This allows you to take regular payments over your life expectancy or the life expectancies of yourself and your designated beneficiary.

**Benefits of SoSEPs**
---------------------

*   Avoid additional taxes on early distributions
*   Simplify management of complex retirement plans

**How Do SoSEPs Work?**
-------------------------

1.  **Eligibility**: You must be separated from service with the employer maintaining the plan.
2.  **Establishing a SoSEP**: The account balance is divided into annual payments based on life expectancy or the life expectancies of you and your designated beneficiary.
3.  **Payment Amounts**: Payments are made periodically, with the amount adjusted annually based on inflation.

**Taxation of SoSEPs**
----------------------

*   No additional tax applies to SoSEPs if the distribution meets the requirements
*   The 10% penalty for early distributions is waived under Section 72(t)(2)(A)

**Modifying or Changing a SoSEP**
---------------------------------

*   You cannot make additional contributions to the account or take distributions from the account, except for the annual payment under the SoSEP
*   You can change the method of determining the SoSEP amount after establishing it, but only by reason of death, disability, or disqualification

**Exceptions and Limitations**
------------------------------

*   The 10% penalty applies to early distributions made before age 59 ½
*   There may be other exceptions and limitations depending on your individual circumstances

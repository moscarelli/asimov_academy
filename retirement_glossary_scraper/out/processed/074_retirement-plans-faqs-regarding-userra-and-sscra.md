Retirement Plans FAQs regarding USERRA and SSCRA
==============================

**USERRA and SSCRA: What You Need to Know**

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA) provide rights and protections for veterans, reservists, and their families. This FAQ provides general information about these laws and how they apply to retirement plans.

**General Information**

*   USERRA is administered by the Department of Labor, through the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS). Information and a USERRA Resource Guide are available at [DOL.gov/vets](http://DOL.gov/vets).
*   These FAQs provide general information and should not be cited as any type of legal authority. They provide the user with information responsive to general inquiries.

**Employer Contributions**

*   What is the basic rule for employers re-employing veterans?
    Employer contributions must fund pension benefits that a re-employed participant did not receive due to qualifying military service.
*   How does that work for profit-sharing or money purchase pension plans?
    Employers must make the non-elective employer contributions that would have been made during the military service period.
*   How should compensation be calculated for the leave?
    To calculate the amount of the makeup contributions and allocations, assume the rehired employee earned compensation at the same rate they would have received during the military service period (Code section 414(u)(7)). If this is not reasonably certain, use the employee's average compensation during the 12-month period immediately preceding the qualified military service.
*   How long does an employer have to make these makeup contributions?
    There are no specific time limits for making these contributions. However, employers must report and pay these amounts on a timely basis.

**Employee Contributions**

*   Are there rules for contributory defined benefit plans?
    Yes, employees who participate in these plans may be entitled to reimbursement for certain benefits.
*   How long do rehired veterans have to make up elective contributions?
    The length of time an employee has to make up elective contributions depends on the specific plan and employer policies.

**Participant Loans**

*   Can a plan allow for a suspension of plan loan repayments when the participant is performing military service?
    Yes, some plans may permit a temporary suspension of loan repayments during periods of military service.
*   What happens to the loan when the veteran is rehired?
    The loan remains in place and must be repaid according to the terms of the loan agreement.

**W-2 Reporting**

*   An employee elects to do employee makeup contributions to his 401(k) and the contributions span a few years. Such makeup contributions exceed the current year 402(g) limit. How should these contributions be recorded on the W-2 without appearing to exceed the current year limit?
    These contributions should be reported as "makeup contributions" or "reimbursable contributions," rather than as "elective deferrals."

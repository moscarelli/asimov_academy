# Disaster Relief for Retirement Plans and IRAs

## Introduction
In the event of a presidentially declared disaster, the IRS will postpone certain retirement plan and IRA deadlines for affected taxpayers. Most presidentially declared disasters are severe storms (such as tornadoes and hurricanes), but they may also be wildfires, flooding or earthquakes.

## Eligibility
Affected taxpayers are generally people who live in or have a business in an area directly impacted by the disaster.

## Relief Period
The IRS will issue a news release describing the type of relief, which deadlines are being postponed, and the duration of the relief period. Revenue Procedure 2018-58 lists the retirement plan and IRA deadlines that may be postponed because of a disaster.

## Postponed Deadlines
The IRS may postpone all or only certain deadlines listed in Revenue Procedure 2018-58 based on when the disaster occurred and its severity as well as other factors. The following deadlines may be postponed:

*   Extension of the 60-day period for plan participants to deposit eligible rollover distributions to another qualified plan or IRA
*   Extension of the time for a qualified plan to make a required minimum distribution

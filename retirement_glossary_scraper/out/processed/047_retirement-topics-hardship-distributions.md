# Hardship Distributions in Retirement Plans
## What is a hardship distribution?
A hardship distribution from a retirement plan can be made due to an immediate and heavy financial need.

### Immediate and Heavy Financial Need
The employer determines that a participant has an immediate and heavy financial need based on the plan terms and all relevant facts and circumstances. Consumer purchases, such as a boat or television, are generally not considered an immediate and heavy financial need.

### Safe Harbor Distributions

Effective Feb. 23, 2017, 401(k) plans may elect to use the "Summary substantiation method" for the six types of hardship distributions below:

*   Medical care expenses
*   Costs directly related to the purchase of a principal residence (excluding mortgage payments)
*   Tuition, related educational fees and room and board expenses for postsecondary education
*   Payments necessary to prevent eviction from the employee's principal residence or foreclosure on that residence
*   Funeral expenses
*   Certain expenses to repair damage to the employee's principal residence

### Limitations on Hardship Distributions

The amount of a hardship distribution must be limited to the amount necessary to satisfy the need. This rule is satisfied if:

*   The distribution is limited to the amount needed to cover the immediate and heavy financial need
*   The employee couldn't reasonably obtain the funds from another source

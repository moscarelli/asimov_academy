# Choosing a Retirement Plan: Profit Sharing Plan

A profit-sharing plan accepts discretionary employer contributions, and there is no set amount required by law. If you can afford to make some contribution, you can do so, but other years, you don't need to make any.

## How the Contributions Are Divided

If you make contributions, you'll need a set formula for determining how they're divided among employees. One common method is the "comp-to-comp" method:

* Calculate the total compensation (total "comp") of all employees.
* Divide each employee's compensation (employee "comp") by the total comp.
* Multiply each employee's fraction by the amount of the employer contribution.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* Flexible contributions are strictly discretionary
* Good plan if cash flow is an issue

**Cons:**

* Administrative costs may be higher than under more basic arrangements (SEP or SIMPLE IRA plans)
* Need to test that benefits do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees

## Who Contributes

Only the employer contributes to a profit-sharing plan. If a salary deferral feature is added, it becomes a 401(k) plan.

## Contribution Limits

The lesser of:

* 100% of compensation
* $69,000 for 2024 ($66,000 for 2023; $61,000 for 2022; $58,000 for 2021; $57,000 for 2020, subject to cost-of-living adjustments)

## Filing Requirements

Annual filing of a Form 5500-series return/report is required. Participant disclosures are also required.

## Participant Loans and In-Service Withdrawals

Permitted, but subject to possible 10% additional tax if under age 59-1/2 and no other exception applies.

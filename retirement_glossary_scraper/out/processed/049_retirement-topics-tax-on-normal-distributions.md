Tax on Normal Distributions
==========================

Distributions from retirement plans must be included in income unless they represent an employee's own contribution, such as after-tax employee contributions, or if the distribution is a qualified distribution from a designated Roth account.

*   If the employee is under age 59½, see [tax on early distributions](#early-distributions)
*   If the employee was born before January 2, 1936, he or she may use a special tax rule

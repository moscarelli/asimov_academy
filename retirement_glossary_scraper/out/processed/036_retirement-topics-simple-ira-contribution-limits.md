# Retirement Topics - SIMPLE IRA Contribution Limits
=Simple IRA Contributions=
SIMPLE IRA contributions include salary reduction contributions and employer contributions. No other contributions can be made to a SIMPLE IRA plan.

## Salary Reduction Contributions
The amount an employee contributes from their salary to a SIMPLE IRA cannot exceed $16,000 in 2024 ($15,500 in 2023; $14,000 in 2022; $13,500 in 2020 and 2021; $13,000 in 2019 and $12,500 in 2015 – 2018).

## Catch-up Contributions
If permitted by the SIMPLE IRA plan, participants who are age 50 or over at the end of the calendar year can also make catch-up contributions. The catch-up contribution limit for SIMPLE IRA plans is $3,500 in 2023 and 2024 ($3,000 in 2015 – 2022).

## Employer Matching Contributions
The employer is generally required to match each employee's salary reduction contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 3% of the employee's compensation. This requirement does not apply if the employer makes nonelective contributions instead.

## Nonelective Contributions
An employer can choose to make nonelective contributions of 2% of each eligible employee’s compensation. If the employer makes this choice, it must make nonelective contributions whether or not the employee chooses to make salary reduction contributions.

### Contribution Limits

* $16,000 in 2024 ($15,500 in 2023; $14,000 in 2022; $13,500 in 2020 and 2021; $13,000 in 2019 and $12,500 in 2015 – 2018) for salary reduction contributions

* 3% of employee compensation for matching contributions
* 1% to 2% of employee compensation for nonelective contributions

### Time Limits for Contributing Funds

* Employers must deposit employees' salary reduction contributions to the SIMPLE IRA within 30 days after the end of the month in which the employee would have received them in cash.
* Employers must make matching contributions or nonelective contributions by the due date (including extensions) of their federal income tax return for the year.

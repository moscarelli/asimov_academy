# 401(k) Plans

## What is a 401(k) Plan?

A 401(k) plan is a type of retirement savings plan sponsored by employers to benefit their employees. Employees typically contribute pre-tax dollars from their paychecks, and the employer may also make contributions or match employee contributions. The money in a 401(k) grows tax-deferred until withdrawn during retirement.

## Key Features of 401(k) Plans:

- **Pre-tax Contributions:** Employees can contribute funds before taxes are deducted from their paychecks, reducing their taxable income for the year.
- **Employer Matching:** Many employers match employee contributions up to a certain percentage of the employee’s salary. This is often referred to as a “401(k) match.”
- **Growth Tax-Deferred:** Earnings on 401(k) investments compound tax-free until withdrawn, generally at age 59½.
- **Multiple Investment Options:** 401(k) plans usually offer a variety of investment options like mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. Employees can choose from these based on their risk tolerance and retirement goals.
- **Loans and Withdrawals:** Some 401(k) plans allow participants to take loans against the vested amount in their account for qualified reasons like home purchases or major expenses, but withdrawals before age 59½ are generally subject to a 10% penalty unless an exception applies.
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** At age 72, participants must start taking minimum annual distributions from their 401(k) plan, although these may be rolled over into another eligible retirement account.

## Contributing Factors to Consider:

- **Contribution Limits:** The IRS sets an annual limit on how much employees can contribute to a 401(k). In 2023, the limit is $20,500 ($27,000 if age 50 or older).
- **Fiduciary Responsibility:** Plan sponsors (employers) have legal duties as fiduciaries to administer and manage plans prudently for participants’ interests. They should select a trustworthy investment provider and monitor fund choices carefully.
